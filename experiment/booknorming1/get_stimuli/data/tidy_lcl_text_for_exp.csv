L103,MISS NELSON IS MISSING,HARRY ALLARD,47,Detective McSmogg was assigned to the case.
L103,MISS NELSON IS MISSING,HARRY ALLARD,48,He listened to their story.

L103,MISS NELSON IS MISSING,HARRY ALLARD,61,Maybe something terrible happened to Miss Nelson!
L103,MISS NELSON IS MISSING,HARRY ALLARD,62,'Maybe she was gobbled up by a shark!' said one of the kids.
L103,MISS NELSON IS MISSING,HARRY ALLARD,63,But that didn't seem likely. 
L103,MISS NELSON IS MISSING,HARRY ALLARD,64,'Maybe Miss Nelson went to Mars!' said another kid.
L103,MISS NELSON IS MISSING,HARRY ALLARD,65,But that didn't seem likely either.
L103,MISS NELSON IS MISSING,HARRY ALLARD,66,'I know!' exclaimed one know-it-all. 'Maybe Miss Nelson's

L103,MISS NELSON IS MISSING,HARRY ALLARD,68,But that was the least likely of all.
L103,MISS NELSON IS MISSING,HARRY ALLARD,69,The kids in Room 207 became very discouraged.

L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,1,Gerald was a tall giraffe
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,2,whose neck was long and slim.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,3,But his knees were awfully crooked
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,4,and his legs were rather thin.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,5,He was very good at standing still
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,6,and munching shoots off trees.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,7,"But when he tried to run around,"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,8,he buckled at the knees.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,9,Now every year in Africa
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,10,"they hold the Jungle Dance,"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,11,where every single animal
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,12,turns up to skip and prance.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,13,[[Jungle Dance]] And this year when the day arrived
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,14,"poor Gerald felt so sad,"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,15,because when it came to dancing
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,16,he was really very bad.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,17,The warthogs started waltzing
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,18,and the rhinos rock'n' rolled.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,19,The lions danced a tango
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,20,that was elegant and bold.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,21,The chimps all did a cha-cha
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,22,"with a very Latin feel,"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,23,and eight baboons then teamed up
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,24,for a splendid Scottish reel.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,25,"Then he found a little clearing,"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,26,and he looked up at the sky.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,27,"'The moon can be so beautiful,'"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,28,he whispered with a sigh.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,29,'Excuse me!' coughed a cricket
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,30,who'd seen Gerald earlier on.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,31,'But sometimes when you're different
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,32,you just need a different song.'
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,33,'Listen to the swaying grass
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,34,and listen to the trees.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,35,To me the sweetest music
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,36,is those branches in the breeze.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,37,So imagine that the lovely moon
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,38,is playing just for you-
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,39,everything makes music
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,40,if you really want it to.'
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,41,"With that, the cricket smiled"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,42,and picked up his violin.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,43,Then Gerald felt his body
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,44,do the most amazing thing.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,45,"His hooves had started shuffling,"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,46,making circles on the ground.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,47,"His neck was gently swaying,"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,48,and his tail was swishing round.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,49,"He threw his legs out sideways,"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,50,and he swung them everywhere.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,51,Then he did a backward somersault
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,52,and leapt up in the air.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,53,Gerald felt so wonderful
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,54,his mouth was open wide.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,55,"'I am dancing! Yes, I'm dancing!"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,56,I AM DANCING!' Gerald cried.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,57,"Then, one by one, each animal"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,58,who'd been there at the dance
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,59,arrived while Gerald boogied on
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,60,"and watched him, quite entranced."
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,61,"They shouted, 'It's a miracle!"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,62,We must be in a dream.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,63,Gerald's the best dancer
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,64,"that we've ever, ever seen!'"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,65,'How did you learn to dance like that?
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,66,"Please, Gerald, tell us how.'"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,67,But Gerald simply twirled around
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,68,and finished with a bow.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,69,Then he raised his head and looked up
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,70,at the moon and stars above.
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,71,"'We all can dance,' he said,"
L104,GIRAFFES CAN'T DANCE,GILES ANDREAE,72,' when we find music that we love.'

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1,INTRODUCTION
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,2,When Jenny Linsky was having some of her first
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,3,adventures with the Cat Club I was working in the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,4,"children's department of a public library, and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,5,living with a friend who had a bookshop in her house.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,6,Of course we had Jenny's books in both the library
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,7,"and the bookshop. We also had two cats, Sherlock"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,8,Holmes and Dr. Watson. It is partly because of
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,9,those cats that I remember so vividly the first time
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,10,I read THE CAT CLUB aloud to children.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,11,I was on my way to the library one day when we
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,12,were expecting a class of second-graders from a
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,13,nearby school. Suddenly I heard a cat crying
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,14,behind me. It was Dr. Watson. I didn't have time to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,15,take him back home and I didn't dare to leave him
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,16,"for fear he might get lost, so I picked him up and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,17,carried him into the library. Dr . Watson was used
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,18,to having books and people around him and he
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,19,settled himself comfortably on a table in front of
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,20,"the children. They were delighted, of course, and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,21,they loved THE CAT CLUB so much that I decided to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,22,read it again the next day to the third-graders.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,23,That day I hadn't even had time to begin reading
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,24,before a girl raised her hand and said
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,25,"reproachfully, ""When the second grade came, you had a CAT."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,26,"It really didn't seem fair, so I hurried back to the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,27,bookshop and got Sherlock Holmes. He too made
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,28,himself at home on the library table and greatly
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,29,amused the children by standing on his hind legs
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,30,and resting his front paws on the bookshelf above.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,31,He seemed to be looking with interest at a copy of
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,32,THE CAT CLUB on display there. Then he settled
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,33,down for the story. The third grade love? it as much
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,34,as the second grade had. A few days later several
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,35,of the children came in to tell me that they were
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,36,organizing a Cat Club in their neighborhood; they
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,37,had already found thirty-seven cats who could join
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,38,I They wanted Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,39,"be in the club too, even if they couldn't come to the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,40,meetings. I signed their names and thus enrolled
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,41,them as Honorary Members of the Hudson
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,42,Avenue Cat Club.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,43,"As Miss Averill says, Jenny Linsky and the other"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,44,Cat Club members were real cats and she knew
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,45,them all. You will feel that you know them all too.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,46,Once you have made the acquaintance of shy little
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,47,"Jenny, wearing her red scarf, and big strong Pickles"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,48,"in his fireman's helmet, you are not likely to forget"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,49,them. Perhaps you will have favorites. My
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,50,"favorite, next to Jenny Linsky, is Pickles."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,51,There are other stories about the Cat Club that
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,52,are not included in this book. You can probably get
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,53,"those in your library and I think you will want to,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,54,if you love the stories as much as I do.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,55,THE CAT CLUB OR THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JENNY LINSKY
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,56,"In Captain Tinker's garden, once upon a"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,57,"time, there was a Cat Club. All the cats and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,58,kittens in the neighborhood were members.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,59,All but Jenny Linsky.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,60,Jenny Linsky was a small black orphan
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,61,cat who lived with Captain Tinker. He had
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,62,found Jenny in the street where a dog was
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,63,chasing her. No one knew where she had
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,64,come from and the Captain took her home.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,65,He was very kind to Jenny. She had cream
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,66,and chicken every night for supper. Her
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,67,coal black fur grew soft and glossy. Her
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,68,yellow eyes began to have a happy look.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,69,"On day the Captain said to her, ""You"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,70,"and I must always be best friends."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,71,That made Jenny's heart beat fast.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,72,"But the Captain added gently, ""I think a"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,73,lite cat like you should go outdoors
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,74,sometimes and play. Lots of nice cats live in this
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,75,"garden."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,76,Jenny had often heard the Cat Club
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,77,"singing after dark. ""They'd have fun,"" she thought."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,78,"But se was too shy to say ""hello"" to them."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,79,"""Shy little cats need help,"" thought"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,80,Captain Tinker to himself.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,81,"Captain Tinker, who was an old sailor,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,82,liked to make things and many years ago had
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,83,learned to knit. He knitted a woolen scarf
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,84,for Jenny - a bright red woolen scarf to go
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,85,with her black fur and yellow eyes.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,86,How Jenny loved that scarf! How brave
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,87,she felt when she was wearing it! And one
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,88,fine night she put it on and went into the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,89,garden.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,90,It was a lovely garden full of flowers and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,91,trees and bushes. On three sides were rows
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,92,of pink brick houses . On the other side was
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,93,a tall board fence that kept the dogs away.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,94,Jenny and the Captain lived in the brick
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,95,house that was covered with ivy.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,96,Jenny crept softly through the grass and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,97,found a hiding place beneath a rosebush.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,98,There she waited for the Cat Club. She
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,99,waited a long time.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,100,Suddenly a slim white cat sped through
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,101,"the grass, dashed up the maple tree and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,102,"began to sing. This was Concertina, the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,103,Club Secretary. She sang:
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,104,Come all ye cats and kittens
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,105,With your whiskers and your mittens
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,106,"Come a-running, come a-running"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,107,To the Cat Club Jamboree.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,108,Mr. President came first.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,109,Mr. President was a well-fed cat who
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,110,always wore a collar with his name and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,111,number on a tag. He walked slowly out of his
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,112,brick house and took his place - the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,113,"""Chair,"" he called it-on the meeting"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,114,ground beneath the maple tree.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,115,The the others came. They came one by
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,116,one and two by two from darkened doorways
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,117,and over the tall board fence. They formed
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,118,a circle in front of Mr. President.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,119,"CONCERTINA, IN THE MAPLE TREE, GIVES THE"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,120,SIGNAL FOR THE CATS TO COME
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,121,"Just before the meeting, MR. PRESIDENT speaks to his young nephew,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,122,JUNIOR. The fluffy cat is BUTTERFLY. The twins are ROMULUS and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,123,"REMUS. The cat jumping over a flower is MACARONI. SOLOMON, the wise"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,124,"cat who can read, sits on his books and watches the two great fighters,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,125,SINBAD and THE DUKE. The two cats in earnest conversation are the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,126,"sweethearts, ARABELLA and ANTONIO."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,127,Mr. President opened the meeting and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,128,spoke a few brief words about a money
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,129,matter. Afterwards the Club moved to the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,130,porch of Concertina's house.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,131,Jenny stretched her neck and peeping
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,132,through the rose leaves saw everything that
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,133,happened.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,134,"The spotted twin cats, Romulus and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,135,"Remus, crawled through the kitchen"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,136,window and returned with a large paper
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,137,package.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,138,"""A feast! A fish!"" cried all the cats."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,139,They tore off the paper and devoured the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,140,fish.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,141,After they had licked their paws and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,142,"whiskers, the lovely Persian cat, Butterfly,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,143,brought out her nose flute and began to play.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,144,The cats sang and danced and joked until
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,145,"the wee small hours when ,one by one, the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,146,Club went home.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,147,The last cat to go was Jenny Linsky. She
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,148,had not dreamed that cats could have such
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,149,fun.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,150,Night after night she crept into the garden
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,151,and watched the Cat Club from behind the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,152,rosebush.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,153,"What clever cats they are!"" sighed Jenny."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,154,"""All of them can do things. Look at"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,155,Butterfly. She plays a nose flute. Look at Macaroni.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,156,He can dance on his hind legs. And what
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,157,"can I do?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,158,Poor little Jenny! There was nothing she
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,159,could do. But she was content to watch the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,160,others at their fun and frolic.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,161,"One night  her surprise, Romulus and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,162,"Remus who were going to the meeting,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,163,poked their noses right into the rosebush
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,164,"and cried gaily, ""Hi there, sister, you're the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,165,"new cat, aren't you?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,166,The twins were in such lively spirits that
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,167,Jenny did not feel afraid.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,168,"""Yes,"" she answered, ""I am Jenny"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,169,"Linsky."" ""Well Jenny, wouldn't you like to join"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,170,"the Cat Club?"" asked the twins."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,171,They did not give her time to answer.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,172,They whisked her off between them.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,173,But when they reached the meeting
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,174,"ground, fear overcame her. All the other"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,175,"cats were there, staring at her with their"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,176,"gleaming eyes, as if to say, ""And what can"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,177,"you do, little black cat? WHAT CAN"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,178,"YOU DO?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,179,This was too humor Jenny. She gave
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,180,a yowl of terror and fled home.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,181,Next morning Romulus and Remus went
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,182,"to Jenny's house, looked through the garden"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,183,"window and called, ""Jenny! Jenny Linsky!"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,184,Jenny did not answer. She was lying on
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,185,a soapbox in the cellar.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,186,The twins had come to cheer her up and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,187,"they went away, discouraged."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,188,"In the afternoon the Persian cat, the lovely"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,189,"one named Butterfly, pressed her silky face"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,190,"against the windowpane and called, ""Jenny!"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,191,"Jenny Linsky!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,192,Jenny Linsky did not answer. She was still
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,193,lying on the soapbox in the cellar.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,194,"Butterfly, too, went off discouraged."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,195,"In the evening the entire Cat Club,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,196,"singing loudly, trooped through the garden on"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,197,their way to Jenny's house.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,198,Mr. President came first.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,199,Behind him walked Butterfly playing on
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,200,her nose flute.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,201,Concertina followed. She had a high
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,202,"soprano voice and led the singing, and behind"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,203,"her, one by one or two by two, the singers"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,204,marched.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,205,First came Romulus and Remus.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,206,"Next, Mr. President's young nephew,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,207,"Junior, accompanied by Solomon, the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,208,bookish cat.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,209,"The fancy dancer, Macaroni, followed."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,210,He was waltzing.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,211,"Behind Macaroni came the sweethearts,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,212,Arabella and Antonio.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,213,"Lastly marched the two great fighters,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,214,Sinbad and the Duke.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,215,All of them were singing:
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,216,Meow and a purr! We want her!
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,217,Jenny! Jenny! Jenny!
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,218,Alas! They sang too loudly.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,219,A man who could not sleep threw down a
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,220,bucketful of water and broke up their fine
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,221,parade. The members scampered home to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,222,dry their dripping fur.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,223,Thy did not meet again until the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,224,following night when they had other plans and did
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,225,not go to Jenny's house. It was summer and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,226,in the summer Cat Clubs are very busy.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,227,So in the end the Club in Captain Tinker's
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,228,garden quite for got poor Jenny Linsky.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,229,"Still, you cannot blame them. You cannot"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,230,expect other cats to think always of your
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,231,troubles.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,232,Jenny who was ashamed of having run
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,233,"away, now stayed indoors. Time dragged."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,234,Now and then she played games with
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,235,Captain Tinker. But when night came and she
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,236,"heard the cats in the garden, she longed to be"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,237,with them.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,238,"""And that will never happen,"" she sighed."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,239,"""They are too clever. All of them can do"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,240,"things. What can I do? Nothing."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,241,Time passed.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,242,The birds flew south. The honeysuckle
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,243,and the rosebush lost their leaves.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,244,Winter came and everything was frozen.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,245,Then Captain Tinker flooded the garden
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,246,and made a pond where the boys and girls
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,247,could skate.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,248,One day while Jenny watched the skating
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,249,"from the window, she turned suddenly to"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,250,Captain Tinker.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,251,"""I should love to skate,"" she said. ""That's"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,252,"something I could do."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,253,Jenny was surprised that Captain Tinker
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,254,did not answer. She went to him and put her
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,255,paw upon his arm.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,256,"""Captain,"" she said, ""if I could only have"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,257,"some skates."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,258,Captain Tinker remained silent. He sat
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,259,"in his armchair, puffing at his pipe and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,260,looking thoughtful. Jenny did not know that out
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,261,of the corner of his eye the Captain watched
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,262,her as she climbed the stairs.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,263,Upstairs she hunted for skates in bureau
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,264,drawers and on the closet shelves. She found
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,265,nothing.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,266,In the night while Captain Tinker was
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,267,"asleep, Jenny came downstairs and searched"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,268,the downstairs closets.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,269,She ransacked the drawer where Captain
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,270,Tinker kept his fishing tackle. She found
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,271,hooks and lines and corks - but no skates.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,272,In November it snowed - the first snow
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,273,storm Jenny had ever seen. All afternoon
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,274,she watched the snowflakes falling.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,275,By evening the garden was entirely white.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,276,Jenny stole outdoors and hunted in the drifts.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,277,She found snowflakes shaped like flowers
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,278,and stars and spiderwebs - but no skates.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,279,I'm glad Jenny has gone outdoors at
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,280,"last,"" thought Captain Tinker. ""Now we"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,281,"shall see what we shall see."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,282,Bright and early the following day the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,283,Captain went to his workshop in the cellar.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,284,He closed the door behind him and would
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,285,not let Jenny in. All morning she could hear
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,286,him tapping with his hammer.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,287,The mysterious hammering and tapping
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,288,went on for many days. On Christmas Eve
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,289,Captain Tinker came upstairs with
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,290,something in his pocket. Jenny watched him as he
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,291,lit the Christmas candle and pulled back the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,292,curtain.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,293,"""The stars are out,"" said Captain Tinker,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,294,looking at the sky.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,295,"As he said it, he took out of his pocket"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,296,four little --.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,297,Could they be real?
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,298,Jenny stared.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,299,"She reached out and touched them - oh,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,300,"so gently - with her paw. They were real,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,301,"and they were silver, and they had sharp"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,302,shiny blades.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,303,"""Ice skates!"" she whispered. ""Silver ice"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,304,"skates! Oh, Captain..."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,305,The Captain strapped the skates on
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,306,Jenny's paws. They fitted exactly. Her ankles
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,307,wobbled for a moment; then she felt quite
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,308,steady. Captain Tinker tied her scarf and she
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,309,went into the garden.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,310,At the pond he hesitated.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,311,"""Which paw goes first?"" she wondered."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,312,She struck forward on her right front paw
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,313,and glided. Then with her left hind paw she
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,314,gave a shove and glided further. She began
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,315,to skim across the ice.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,316,It was a pretty sight to see her skating
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,317,"with her red muffler streaming, and her"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,318,bright skates flashing in the moonlight. She
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,319,cut figure eights and flowers and stars.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,320,The Cat Club saw her. They were at the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,321,other end of the pond and had been singing
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,322,Christmas carols. Their mouths hung open
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,323,and their bulging eyes were fixed on Jenny
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,324,Linsky.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,325,No one in the Club had ever seen a cat
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,326,skate.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,327,"Suddenly Romulus and Remus cried,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,328,"""Jenny! Jenny Linsky!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,329,"And all the other cats cried, ""Jenny!"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,330,"Jenny Linsky!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,331,She glided toward them.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,332,Romulus and Remus dashed to meet her
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,333,and before she knew it she was standing in
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,334,front of Mr. President.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,335,"""Mr. President,"" said Romulus and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,336,"Remus, ""we hope that this black cat, a friend"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,337,"of ours, will now be asked to join the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,338,"Club."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,339,Mr. President looked at Jenny with his
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,340,beady eyes.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,341,"""What is your name?"" he asked."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,342,"""Jenny Linsky,"" she replied"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,343,"""Where do you live?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,344,"""In Captain Tinker's house."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,345,"""Can you do anything?"" asked Mr."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,346,President.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,347,"""I can skate,"" said Jenny proudly."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,348,"""Yippetty-yip-yip-yip!"" cried all the cats."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,349,"When the cheering died down, Mr."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,350,"President addressed the Club, saying, ""The"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,351,"question is, shall our distinguished guest, Miss"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,352,"Jenny Linsky, who can skate, be asked to"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,353,join the Cat Club. All cats in favor raise a
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,354,"right front paw."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,355,Every member raised a right front paw.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,356,"""All cats opposed kick a left hind leg."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,357,No one kicked a left hind leg.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,358,Two cats went into the bushes to count the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,359,votes. They came back quickly and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,360,whispered in Mr. President's ear. Mr. President
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,361,looked satisfied.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,362,He turned to Jenny.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,363,MR. PRESIDENT

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,370,"Miss Jenny Linsky,"" said Mr. President,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,371,"""the votes have been counted. I have the"

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,377,Jenny could have made a longer speech.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,378,"But the Cat Club crowded around her,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,379,hoping for a chance to touch the silver skates.

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,395,OF MY EARLY LIFE

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,397,JENNY'S
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,398,FIRST PARTY
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,399,"One summer night the little black cat,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,400,"Jenny Linsky, climbed over the tall board"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,401,fence at the end of the garden behind her
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,402,"home, crept through a private passage"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,403,and came out on South Street.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,404,Jenny walked up the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,405,street until she came to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,406,Hook and Ladder Company
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,407,Number 7 X of the New York City Fire
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,408,Department.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,409,"""Whoo hoo, Pickles,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,410,she called softly from
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,411,the sidewalk.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,412,"Pickles, the big,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,413,"spotted, yellow cat"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,414,who was the mascot
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,415,"of the Company, was"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,416,upstairs ...  playing
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,417,checkers with the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,418,firemen.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,419,When he heard
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,420,"the ""whoo hoo,"" he"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,421,put on his fireman's
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,422,"helmet, slid down"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,423,"the firemen's pole,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,424,walked around the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,425,Hook and Ladder
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,426,for good luck and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,427,went out to Jenny.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,428,"""Hi, Jenny,"" said Pickles. ""What's doing?"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,429,"Where's Captain Tinker?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,430,Pickles was referring to Jenny's friend and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,431,"master, the old sea captain, Captain Tinker,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,432,in whose house she lived.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,433,"""Captain Tinker has gone out,"" said"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,434,"Jenny. ""He went out for supper."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,435,"""What about the Cat Club?"" Pickles"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,436,"asked, referring to the Club that met each"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,437,night in Captain Tinker's garden.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,438,"""Something happened,"" Jenny said. ""Mr."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,439,President has told us that we can't meet
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,440,"again until it gets straightened out."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,441,"""So you came here,"" said Pickles, with a"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,442,"note of kindness in his queer, rough voice."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,443,"""So you came here to see your old friend,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,444,"Pickles."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,445,"""Yes Pickles, I was lonely,"" Jenny said."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,446,"Then she added shyly, ""Pickles, let's go"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,447,"somewhere. Let's have some fun."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,448,"""I haven't any money for a party,"" Pickles"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,449,"said. ""I'm broke. Have you any money?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,450,"""No,"" said Jenny, ""I'm broke, too."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,451,Jenny poked her paw in a crack in the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,452,"sidewalk, as if she hoped to find a penny."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,453,"When no coin appeared, she said,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,454,"""Captain Tinker says that money isn't"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,455,"everything."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,456,"""I'm not so sure,"" said Pickles."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,457,"He turned his big, spotted, yellow, face"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,458,toward the sky to find out about the weather.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,459,The night was crystal clear. Up high the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,460,moon was swimming like a great liquid
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,461,"silver dollar. As for the stars, Pickles felt"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,462,that he could touch them if he held out
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,463,his paw.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,464,"''All right,"" he said to Jenny. ""Let's get"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,465,"going. You lead the way."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,466,"""Me lead?"" gulped Jenny."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,467,She was jut a small black cat and very
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,468,shy. She had never been a leader.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,469,"""Tell me where you want to go,"" said"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,470,Pickles briskly.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,471,"""Let's go and get Florio,"" said Jenny."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,472,Florio lived around the corner. He was
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,473,"a young, golden-haired cat who was as"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,474,"handsome as a prince. Best of all, he was gentle"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,475,in his ways and very gay.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,476,Florio was lying
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,477,upstairs on a satin
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,478,cushion when he
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,479,heard their soft
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,480,"""whoo hoos."" He"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,481,"stood up, pulled"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,482,back the window
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,483,curtain and gave
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,484,a silent signal.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,485,A few minutes later Florio came out. He
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,486,had had to wait and slip out secretly. His
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,487,mistress would have died of fright if she
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,488,had known that he was on the sidewalks of
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,489,New York.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,490,When Florio realized that Pickles was
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,491,wearing his fireman's helmet and that Jenny
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,492,"had on the red scarf that her master, Captain"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,493,"Tinker, had knitted, he borrowed an Indian"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,494,feathered headdress from the doorman.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,495,"""Hello,"" said Florio, as he joined his two"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,496,"friends on the sidewalk. ""Are we going to"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,497,"have a party?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,498,"""Not unless you have some money,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,499,Pickles answered.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,500,"""I haven't any money"" said the golden-"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,501,"haired cat. ""I'm broke."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,502,Pickles sighed.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,503,"But Jenny said, ""It would be fun to have"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,504,"some fun."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,505,Florio looked at Jenny.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,506,"""Where would you like to go?"" he asked."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,507,"""Oh, anywhere,"" said Jenny"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,508,"Pickles said to her, ""Name one idea."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,509,Jenny thought a moment. Se tried to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,510,"think what her master, Captain Tinker,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,511,would do in such a situation.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,512,"""Certainly he would do something,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,513,"Jenny told herself. ""He would think up"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,514,"games or have a catnip hunt or something."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,515,A bright idea flashed through her mind.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,516,"""Let's find a doorway and  secret"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,517,"passage!"" she cried. ""It might lead to an"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,518,"enchanted palace!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,519,"""And to hidden"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,520,"treasure!"" Pickles cried."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,521,"""And Indians!"" cried"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,522,Florio
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,523,They started down the street: Jenny with
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,524,"her bright red scarf, Pickles with his"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,525,fireman's helmet and Florio with his Indian
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,526,feathered headdress.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,527,They walked on many streets all the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,528,streets were lighted with electric lights. And
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,529,all the doors were locked.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,530,"After a while, Pickles was ready to go"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,531,home. Even Florio was growing
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,532,discouraged. But Jenny was having a wonderful
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,533,time. She had never been on the streets at
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,534,"night. ""Oh, please,"" she begged, ""let's go just a"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,535,"little farther."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,536,"So they went a little farther, choosing"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,537,streets that were darker and more filled with
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,538,mystery and moonlight.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,539,"All of a sudden Jenny said, ""Do you hear"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,540,"what I hear?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,541,They listened.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,542,They looked down a small side street
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,543,that had no light but the moonlight. Over
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,544,the rooftops rose the laughter of many cats.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,545,"""It sounds like a party,"" said Pickles."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,546,And he straightened his fireman's helmet.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,547,Florio straightened his Indian feathered
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,548,"headdress and said, ""Yes, perhaps we'll have"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,549,"a party after all."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,550,"But the little black cat, Jenny Linsky,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,551,did not say anything. She was too excited.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,552,She had never been to a party.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,553,"After a moment Pickles said, ""You two"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,554,"wait here. I'll go and scout."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,555,"Pickles disappeared down the dark street,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,556,"came back shortly and said, ""I've found the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,557,"gate."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,558,Then he led his two friends to a wooden
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,559,gate that was open just wide enough to let
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,560,a cat slip through . One by one they did slip
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,561,"through and in the moonlight, in a big,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,562,"deserted yard, they saw what they were"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,563,"looking for: a party, a party just for cats."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,564,There were striped cats and yellow cats
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,565,and white and grey and speckled cats.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,566,All of them were dancing in the silver
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,567,moonlight.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,568,How their legs flashed! How their
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,569,whiskers glittered!
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,570,In the center of the party was a fluffy cat
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,571,who danced the tumba rumba.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,572,"""That fluffy one must be Alice"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,573,"Featherlegs,"" whispered Florio to Pickles."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,574,"Pickles whispered, ""You're right. It is"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,575,"Alice."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,576,"""Alice Featherlegs!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,577,Jenny had never seen her before. But she
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,578,had heard of Alice. What cat had not heard
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,579,"of Alice Featherlegs, who was famous for"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,580,her beauty and the way she danced the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,581,tumba rumba?
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,582,Before long Alice Featherlegs caught
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,583,sight of the three new arrivals. She ran over
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,584,"to them, and her soft fur made a rustling"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,585,sound as she drew near.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,586,How elegant and full of grace she
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,587,seemed! Jenny could not take her eyes away
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,588,from her.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,589,But Alice did not even glance at Jenny.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,590,Alice looked only at Florio and Pickles.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,591,She acted just as if she never spoke to little
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,592,cats.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,593,Alice's behavior made poor Jenny feel
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,594,extremely small and plain.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,595,Jenny could hear the fluffy creature say
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,596,"to the two bigger cats, ""How wonderful of"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,597,you to come! I think we may have met
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,598,"before. But anyway, will you join our party?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,599,"""We should like to very much,"" said"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,600,"Pickles, bowing like a fireman."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,601,"Then Pickles said, ""Miss Featherlegs,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,602,"may I present our friend, Jenny Linsky?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,603,"Alice answered in a far-off voice, ""My,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,604,what a pretty little cat. But isn't she too
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,605,"young to dance the tumba rumba?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,606,"Jenny wanted to say, ""I don't know how"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,607,"to dance it. But I think I could learn."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,608,"Try as she would, Jenny could not make"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,609,the words come out. And before she knew
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,610,"what had happened, she was sitting on the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,611,top of an upturned basket.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,612,"""This is just the place for Jenny,"" Alice"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,613,"said to Pickles and Florio. ""She can watch"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,614,"us dance, or she can take a nap."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,615,Take a nap! What a horrid thing to say
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,616,to a little black cat at her first party.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,617,Jenny sat absolutely still and held back
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,618,her tears.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,619,Florio whose light paws tingled with the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,620,"music, said to Jenny, ""Please don't worry."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,621,"We'll only dance once."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,622,"And Pickles said to her, ""That's true."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,623,"Then we'll come right back to you."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,624,Jenny watched her two best friends go
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,625,off with Alice Featherlegs. Immediately
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,626,they were the center of the party. Time was
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,627,nothing to them. Time is nothing to a cat
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,628,when he is dancing.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,629,Pickles and Florio danced on and on.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,630,Now and then they glanced at Jenny to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,631,make sure that she was safe. They could see
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,632,"her sitting safely on the basket, but they"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,633,could not see that she was lonely.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,634,Jenny had never felt so sad in all her life.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,635,She began to wish that she were at home
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,636,"with her dear master, Captain Tinker. She"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,637,wished that she were sitting on the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,638,Captain's lap.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,639,The Captain knew how to comfort her.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,640,He always told her that her troubles could
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,641,be straightened out.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,642,Right now it seemed that she could
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,643,al.most hear the Captain's voice. It seemed to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,644,"her that he was saying, ""Jenny dear, don't"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,645,"sit there, feeling sorry for yourself. Get up"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,646,"and do something. Get up and dance."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,647,"""I don't know how to dance the tumba"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,648,"rumba,"" answered Jenny."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,649,"And the Captain said, ""Then dance the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,650,"dance I taught you."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,651,The Captain meant the old-time sailor's
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,652,dance: the sailor's hornpipe.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,653,Although Jenny had danced the sailor's
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,654,"hornpipe once or twice at home, she had"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,655,never danced it in public. So she climbed
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,656,down to practice it behind the basket. She
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,657,wanted to make sure that she knew all the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,658,steps before she danced it in front of Alice
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,659,Featherlegs.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,660,Jenny stood up on her left hind leg and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,661,twirled around. She waved her left front
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,662,paw above her head and softly gave the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,663,"sailor's cry: ""Hi ho!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,664,Then she skipped gracefully and twirled
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,665,around on her right leg. And once again
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,666,"she called, ""Hi ho! Hi ho!""."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,667,"""That's the way to dance the hornpipe,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,668,Jenny thought.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,669,She was surprised to find that she could
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,670,"dance it very well, and she went on"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,671,"practicing it behind the basket, out of sight."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,672,When Pickles happened to look over to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,673,"make sure that Jenny was all right, Jenny"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,674,was now here to be seen. All that could be
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,675,seen was one black front paw appearing
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,676,from behind the basket and then
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,677,disappearing. In a second another front paw rose
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,678,and flapped and disappeared.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,679,Pickles was terrified.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,680,"""Jenny is drowning!"" he cried."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,681,He left Alice Featherlegs and rushed off
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,682,to rescue Jenny. Florio ran after him. But
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,683,"when they looked behind the basket, there"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,684,was no water. Jenny was not drowning.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,685,Jenny was on dry ground - dancing the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,686,sailor's hornpipe!
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,687,"""Well, well,"" said Pickles with a note"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,688,"of admiration in his queer, rough voice."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,689,"And Florio cried, ""Oh Jenny, will you"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,690,"dance with me?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,691,"Pickles wanted to dance with Jenny, too."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,692,So Jenny said she would dance with both
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,693,"together, and they led her out into the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,694,moonlit yard.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,695,How proud she was to teach them
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,696,how to dance the sailor's hornpipe!
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,697,The three friends were soon dancing so
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,698,beautifully that all the other cats rushed
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,699,over to them. All but Alice.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,700,Alice was left alone in the middle of
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,701,the yard.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,702,After a while she grew tired of being by
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,703,"herself. She joined the others, and several"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,704,of her old friends taught her how to dance
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,705,the sailors hornpipe. But she could not
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,706,dance it half so well as Jenny.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,707,"Jenny led the dancers. Oh, what fun they"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,708,"had! Their cries - ""Hi ho! Hi ho!"" - rose"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,709,high above the rooftops and drifted toward
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,710,the moon.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,711,Jenny danced until the early hours of
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,712,the morning. Then her small black paws
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,713,grew weary.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,714,"Pickles said to Florio, ""It's time to go."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,715,The three cats thanked the others for
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,716,the lovely party.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,717,"Florio said to them, ""We'll have to have"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,718,"another party soon."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,719,"And Jenny said, ""I'll give the party at"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,720,"my house. All of you must come."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,721,"""Hi ho! We'll come!"" cried all the cats."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,722,All but Alice Featherlegs.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,723,Jenny looked at Alice.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,724,"""Alice you must come, too,"" said Jenny."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,725,"""My master, Captain Tinker, will be nice"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,726,"to you."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,727,"Jenny, Florio and Pickles pattered down"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,728,the street toward home. At Jenny's house
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,729,they sighed happily and parted.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,730,Jenny crawled through the window that
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,731,"her master, Captain Tinker, had left open"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,732,for her. She went upstairs and sleepily
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,733,rattled the doorknob of the Captain's
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,734,bedroom door. The Captain heard her and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,735,got out of bed and let her into the room.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,736,He took her in his arms and stroked her
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,737,gently and untied her bright red scarf.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,738,"""Oh, Captain, we went dancing,"" Jenny"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,739,"murmured, ""and I could dance forever!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,740,The Captain looked at her and smiled.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,741,Jenny had fallen asleep.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,742,WHEN JENNY LOST HER SCARF
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,743,"O, happy"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,744,Are we
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,745,On our
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,746,Annual Spree.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,747,- FROM AND OLD
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,748,MARCHING SONG
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,749,OF THE CAT CLUB
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,750,"One fine spring day the little black cat,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,751,"Jenny Linsky, sat at the open window of"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,752,her house. Dreamily she watched her red
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,753,scarf drying on a clothesline in the garden.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,754,"""I'm glad the housekeeper washed my"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,755,"scarf,"" thought Jenny. ""Now it will be fresh"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,756,and clean for me to wear to the Annual
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,757,"Spring Picnic of the Cat Club."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,758,"But all at once a rough dog, whom the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,759,"club had christened ""Rob the Robber,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,760,"rushed out of a cellar, grabbed Jenny's scarf"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,761,and ran off with it. It happened so quickly
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,762,that Jenny didn't have time to think or be
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,763,scared. All she wanted was to get her scarf
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,764,away from Rob. So she cut through the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,765,"garden, climbed over the tall board fence and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,766,ran down the alley into South Street.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,767,"By sniffing the sidewalk, Jenny found the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,768,trail of the dog and the scarf. She followed
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,769,the trail as far as the Toy and Catnip Shop
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,770,which stood
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,771,at the corner of the block.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,772,Here Rob's trail turned sharply around
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,773,"the corner, into Mulligan Street."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,774,"""I guess he's taken my scarf to the Den"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,775,"of the Dogs,"" thought Jenny with a shiver."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,776,She crept close to the Toy and Catnip
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,777,Shop and peered cautiously down Mulligan
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,778,Street toward the dark cellar where Rob and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,779,his band of dogs had their den. There was
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,780,not a dog in sight.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,781,"""They're probably all inside, pawing my"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,782,"scarf,"" thought Jenny . ""But I'll go into the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,783,"den and get my scarf, even if they chew"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,784,"me up."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,785,"Fortunately, at this very moment, two"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,786,"friendly voices called out, behind her,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,787,"""Jenny! Jenny Linsky! Wait for us!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,788,"Jenny turned and saw the twin cats,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,789,"Romulus and Remus, standing on the curb across"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,790,"the street. Of course she waited for them,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,791,And when the traffic light turned from red
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,792,"to green, the patchy-coated twins came"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,793,bounding over to her.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,794,"""Jenny, what has happened?"" cried the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,795,"twins together. ""What are you doing out in"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,796,"the street, without your scarf?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,797,"""That Rob the Robber stole it,"" replied"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,798,Jenny indignantly . And she told them what
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,799,had happened.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,800,"The twins said, ""Well, Jenny, we admire"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,801,"your spirit, but really you're no match for"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,802,Rob. Why don't you go home? We'll try to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,803,get your scarf and bring it to the Cat Club
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,804,"tonight."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,805,The twins pushed Jenny with their
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,806,speckled noses. She ran home and waited.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,807,She waited all that afternoon; waited until
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,808,the sun dropped in the west; waited until
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,809,night descended and the cats began to gather
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,810,beneath the maple tree that stood in the far
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,811,corner of the Captain's garden. When they
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,812,had formed a circle in front of their
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,813,"President, Jenny crept over to them."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,814,Romulus and Remus had saved a place for
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,815,"her between them, and as she squeezed into"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,816,"it they whispered to her, ""No luck. No luck."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,817,"""Silence, please,"" ordered the President."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,818,"""The meeting is about to open."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,819,"""But this is important, Mr. President,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,820,"the twins objected. ""It's about Jenny's scarf."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,821,"It was stolen this morning."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,822,Mr. President quickly opened the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,823,meeting.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,824,"""Jenny,"" he said gravely, ""will you please"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,825,"step forward and tell us what happened?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,826,Shyly the little black cat stepped into the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,827,circle in front of Mr. President.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,828,Jenny's neck felt cold and bare without
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,829,her red wool scarf tied snugly around it.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,830,And all those pairs of cat eyes staring at
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,831,her through the moonlight frightened her.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,832,But she knew she had to speak. She must
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,833,make the Cat Club understand how
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,834,important was the scarf she had lost.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,835,"""Mr. President,"" said Jenny, ""this"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,836,morning Rob the Robber stole the red wool scarf
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,837,"my master, Captain Tinker, knit for me to"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,838,wear wherever I go. Captain Tinker has
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,839,gone off to sea on business. When he comes
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,840,"home, I don't want to have to tell him that I"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,841,"lost my scarf. I'll try my best to get it back."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,842,"""Thank you, Jenny. You may be seated,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,843,"said Mr. President. ""Romulus and Remus,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,844,kindly tell us what you know about this
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,845,"robbery."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,846,"As Jenny sat down, the twins stepped"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,847,forward and explained how they had met Jenny
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,848,and why they had sent her home.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,849,"""Then we followed Rob's trail to the Den"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,850,"of the Dogs on Mulligan Street,"" said the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,851,"twins. ""But Rob was guarding the door. He"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,852,shouted to us that Jenny's scarf was hanging
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,853,"on a nail in the den, and that a thousand"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,854,cats could never get it back because the den
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,855,"would be guarded day and night."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,856,"""Thank you Romulus and Remus,"" said"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,857,"Mr. President. ""You may be seated, for I can"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,858,"see that Madame Butterfly wishes to speak."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,859,"As the twins returned to their seats, the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,860,"club's most beautiful member, the silvery"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,861,"Madame Butterfly, stepped forward."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,862,"""This robbery bristles my whiskers,"" she"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,863,"declared. ""At noon, while I was out"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,864,"shopping, I met Romulus and Remus. They told"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,865,"me all about it. Of course, I feel that what"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,866,happened to Jenny this morning happened
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,867,because of what happened here last
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,868,"Hallowe'en."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,869,"""Excuse me, Madame Butterfly,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,870,"interrupted tough Sinbad. ""What has what"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,871,happened here last Hallowe'en got to do with
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,872,our  Annual  Spring  Picnic? Tonight the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,873,club's supposed to al out our picnic
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,874,"plans."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,875,"""Patience, Sinbad,"" replied Butterfly. ""I"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,876,"have a surprise for all of you. Look!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,877,Slowly Butterfly opened her Silvery right
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,878,front paw. Between two of its velvety pads
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,879,"lay a diamond, brighter than a star."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,880,Jenny's yellow eyes almost popped out of her
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,881,"head, and cries of Oh! and Ah! and Please"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,882,may I touch it? went round the club.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,883,"Butterfly, guarding the diamond, said, ""I"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,884,have removed this jewel from the trimming
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,885,"on my nose flute, and I'm giving it to the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,886,club to pay for whatever it costs to get back
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,887,Jenny's scarf. What's left over shall be spent
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,888,"on buying food for our picnic."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,889,"Sinbad asked, ""Do you"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,890,mean we can't have our
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,891,picnic until we've found Jenny's
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,892,"scarf?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,893,"""Exactly so,"" replied"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,894,"Butterfly. ""Last Hallowe'en Jenny risked her"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,895,"life to bring me my flute, which I had lost."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,896,"To do this, she had to outsmart Rob and all"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,897,his dogs. Today Rob got even with Jenny by
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,898,stealing her scarf. But I intend to help her
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,899,"get it back with this diamond."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,900,"Mr. President took the diamond happily,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,901,for there was not a penny in the treasury.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,902,"""Mr. President,"" cried Sinbad, ""why not"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,903,"buy Jenny a new scarf, instead of waiting"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,904,to get the old one back? Then we could
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,905,"hold our picnic on Saturday night, as we'd"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,906,"planned."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,907,"The members nodded. And Butterfly said,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,908,"""Jenny, shall you and I go to the Toy and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,909,"Catnip Shop and try to buy a little scarf?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,910,"""No,"" thought Jenny to herself. ""All the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,911,diamonds in this city couldn't buy me
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,912,anything as nice as my old red scarf. That was
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,913,"the first scarf I ever had."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,914,"But Sinbad was saying, ""I know where we"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,915,"can buy fine fishes for a picnic - cheap."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,916,"""Oh!"" sighed Jenny. ""The club does want"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,917,"the picnic. Without the picnic, it won't"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,918,"seem to them like spring at all."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,919,"She raised her voice. ""Thank you,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,920,"Madame Butterfly. I'll go shopping with you."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,921,So Butterfly took back the diamond and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,922,arranged to call for Jenny at
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,923,ten o'clock next morning. And
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,924,"from breakfast until ten, Jenny"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,925,polished her fur and whiskers
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,926,for the shopping trip.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,927,"""Jenny, how nice you look!"" said"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,928,"Butterfly, when she arrived. ""Come, let's start"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,929,"before those dogs get wind of our plans."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,930,"Side by side, the two cats crossed the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,931,"garden, jumped over the fence, passed into"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,932,South Street and dashed to the Toy and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,933,"Catnip Shop. As they pushed open the door, the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,934,owner looked at them with surprise.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,935,"""My good woman,"" said Butterfly, ""have"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,936,you a red scarf or my young friend to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,937,"wear?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,938,The woman did not seem to understand.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,939,"""Maybe a pink scarf,"" suggested Butterfly."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,940,Again the owner failed to understand.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,941,"""Or a little blue scarf,"" said Butterfly,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,942,flashing he diamond she carried in her paw.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,943,"""Oh!"" exclaimed the woman. ""If you want"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,944,"to buy a toy for her, she might enjoy this"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,945,"duck."" And she placed a big toy duck on the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,946,floor in front of Jenny.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,947,"""A duck to play with, when I need a scarf,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,948,"thought Jenny miserably. But to be polite,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,949,she gave its tail a push.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,950,"""Quack!"" shrieked the duck. ""Quack!"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,951,"Quack!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,952,"""Come Jenny,"" said Butterfly in disgust."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,953,"""If this store doesn't understand us, no store"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,954,"will. We might as well go home."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,955,"That night, at the club, Butterfly had to"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,956,report that the shopping trip had failed. As
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,957,"she returned the diamond to Mr . President,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,958,"she sad, ""There's nothing left to do but"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,959,"think of a way to get the old scarf back."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,960,"""Yes,"" agreed Mr.President, ""let us close"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,961,"our eyes and think."""""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,962,"So they all closed their eyes and thought,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,963,but no one could think of a plan. When the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,964,meeting finally broke up everyone felt blue.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,965,"Saturday night was drawing near, and it"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,966,looked as if there wouldn't be picnic.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,967,As Jenny paused in the window of her
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,968,"house, on her way to bed, she murmured,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,969,"""The club has done everything it can to help."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,970,"If we're to have the picnic, I must get help"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,971,"from somewhere else. But from whom?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,972,"Suddenly she remembered her friend, the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,973,"Fire Cat, Pickles, who worked in he Fire"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,974,House on South Street. Pickles had once told
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,975,"her, ""If you ever need me, let me know."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,976,Jenny knew it wouldn't be much fun to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,977,"travel on the streets at night, without her"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,978,scarf to bring good luck. Perhaps those
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,979,dogs would catch her. Never mind. She'd
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,980,do the best she could. And without
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,981,"thinking of her own safety, she ran to the fence,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,982,jumped over it and sped down South Street
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,983,toward the Fire House. Fortunately she
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,984,reached it safely and found Pickles on duty.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,985,"""Jenny, what's the matter?"" he asked."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,986,"""Rob the Robber stole my scarf,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,987,"explained Jenny. ""And he's hung it in the Den"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,988,of the Dogs. The den is guarded so no cats
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,989,can get in. And one thing has led to another.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,990,Now our club can't have its Annual Spring
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,991,"Picnic until we get back my scarf."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,992,"""I wish I could help you,"" said Pickles."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,993,"""Pickles,"" said Jenny, ""you're a friend of"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,994,"the Fire Dog, Buster. He's a good dog, and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,995,maybe you could ask him to tell Rob to give
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,996,"me back my scarf."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,997,"""Buster's a very good dog,"" agreed"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,998,"Pickles. ""But he works in a fire house way"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,999,uptown. I won't see him until the Firemen's
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1000,"Ball in the summer. You run home, Jenny."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1001,It's long past your bedtime. I won't forget
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1002,what you've told me. With dogs like those
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1003,"Mulligan ruffians, anything might happen."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1004,"It happened that same night, while Jenny"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1005,was asleep in her basket in her upstairs
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1006,"bedroom, next to the street. She had been"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1007,"dreaming that the club was holding the picnic, and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1008,"she was with them, eating a delicious fish,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1009,when she was awakened by the fire engines
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1010,roaring along South Street.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1011,Sleepily she thought of Pickles on the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1012,front seat of the hook and ladder - riding to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1013,put out the fire. How safe she felt because
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1014,of Pickles! How proud she was to know
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1015,him! She was drifting back to sleep when
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1016,she heard a psst! psst! beneath her window.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1017,Jenny ran to the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1018,window and peered
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1019,into the street.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1020,On the sidewalk stood Romulus and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1021,Remus.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1022,"""The Den of the Dogs is on fire!"" cried"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1023,"the twins. ""Those dogs were playing with a"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1024,box of matches they stole this afternoon.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1025,Jimminy whiskers! What a fire they started!
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1026,"We're going back to watch the blaze."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1027,The twins dashed away and disappeared
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1028,around the corner of the street.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1029,"""I must go, too,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1030,"thought Jenny. ""My"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1031,red scarf is in the den.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1032,There 's no time to lose.

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1035,Jenny hurried down the stairs that led to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1036,the garden window. As her black paws sped
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1037,"from stair to stair, her mind kept saying,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1038,"""My red scarf is in the den, and Pickles"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1039,has gone over there to fight the fire. Pickles

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1043,Jenny leaped through the open window
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1044,and ran across the garden to the fence.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1045,There she gathered her little black legs
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1046,together and made ready to jump to the top of

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1049,"She tried again, and again her hind legs"

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1053,It's just as if I wasn't meant to go to

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1056,Suddenly the reason became as clear to

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1058,duty was to fight the fire and keep it from

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1060,"""I musn't bother Pickles,"" Jenny decided."

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1066,Jenny glanced around the garden. It was

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1083,At last Jenny could hear the hook and

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1085,"The bell of the hook and ladder was ringing,"

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1087,she heard four paws turn into the alley.

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1092,"""Fire's out! Fire's out!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1093,"Jenny heard someone jump, and saw a"

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1098,"""Catch!"" boomed the Fire Cat."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1099,Jenny reached up and caught the scarf. It

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1126,"At that same moment, something moved"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1127,toward her through the bushes. When she

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1277,"floor. He bounded after it,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1278,"caught with his teeth,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1279,returned with it and laid
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1280,it at the Captain's
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1281,feet.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1282,"The Captain said to Checkers, ""That was"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1283,the most beautiful retiring I've ever seen.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1284,"And such a pretty ball!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1285,"Checkers whispered to Jenny, ""Hit the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1286,ball again. I must retrieve some more to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1287,"help get Edward adopted."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1288,"But Captain Tinker picked up the ball,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1289,"and looking thoughtfully at Checkers, said,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1290,"""You're hungry, and a red ball never filled"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1291,an empty stomach. You must stay and eat
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1292,"some lunch with Jenny. After that - why,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1293,"after that, you may live with us forever, if"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1294,"you wish."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1295,"""Checkers,"" cried Jenny happily, ""you've"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1296,"been adopted. Now I'll call Edward."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1297,She turned toward the window. To her
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1298,surprise she saw that Edward had come to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1299,the window sill without waiting to be called.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1300,On his striped face there was a look that
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1301,Jenny had never seen on any cat. It was the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1302,look of a cat gazing at something warm and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1303,beautiful which he may have to leave because
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1304,he is not wanted.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1305,"""Oh!"" thought Jenny. ""The Captain"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1306,mustn't send Edward away; it would break
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1307,his heart. I must speak to the Captain about
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1308,"this and try to make him understand."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1309,Jenny was on the point of jumping onto
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1310,"her master's knees to plead for Edward,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1311,when the Captain caught sight of the face
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1312,at the window. And he saw Checkers glance
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1313,quickly at the face. Then Checkers sat very
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1314,"straight and still, like someone wishing hard"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1315,for something to come true.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1316,"""These two cats belong together,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1317,murmured Captain Tinker.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1318,Without another word he walked to the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1319,window and pulled Edward gently into the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1320,room. In that way Edward was adopted.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1321,Afterward the Captain took
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1322,off Jenny's scarf and hung it
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1323,on its hook. He put Checkers'
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1324,red ball in a glass bowl on the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1325,shelf above the scarf.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1326,"Then the Captain said to Edward, ""You"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1327,haven't a red ball and you haven't a red scarf
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1328,"But you shall soon have something red, so"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1329,that everyone will know you are one of us.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1330,After lunch I'll make you a red leather
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1331,"collar."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1332,"""My!"" thought Jenny. ""How quickly"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1333,things have happened. My brothers came.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1334,They were adopted. What will happen
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1335,"next?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1336,Jenny and her brothers followed Captain
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1337,Tinker into the kitchen. There he put two
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1338,"extra plates on Jenny's feeding tray, and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1339,filled all three of the plates with carrots
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1340,and beef.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1341,The brothers could not believe their eyes.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1342,It was so long since they had seen a meal like
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1343,this. They tried to purr their thanks to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1344,Captain Tinker. But their purrs got mixed with
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1345,their food.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1346,Each mouthful that the brothers ate put
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1347,new life into their tired bodies. When lunch
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1348,"was over and they had washed their faces,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1349,Checkers and Edward looked like happy
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1350,cats. Jenny no longer felt sorry for them.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1351,"Edward turned to her and asked politely,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1352,"""Do you think the Captain has a little office"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1353,"where I might do some writing?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1354,"""Captain Tinker has gone down to his"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1355,"workshop in the cellar,"" replied Jenny. ""I'll"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1356,take you through our house. I'm sure you'll
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1357,"find an office somewhere."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1358,Jenny led Edward and Checkers up the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1359,stairs. At the top of the stairs she said
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1360,"proudly, ""Our house has three floors. This"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1361,"is the second floor, and - """
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1362,Suddenly Jenny remembered the day when
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1363,she herself was adopted by Captain Tinker.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1364,"The Captain, after rescuing her from trouble"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1365,"in the street, had brought her into this same"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1366,house and allowed her to explore it by
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1367,"herself, the way cats like to do."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1368,"So Jenny told her brothers, ""You may"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1369,explore this second floor. I'll wait for you
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1370,"downstairs."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1371,Jenny returned to the living room and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1372,"waited on the sofa. While she waited, she"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1373,"could hear the brothers exploring overhead,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1374,from room to room. With each step and sniff
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1375,"they made, she felt that Checkers and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1376,Edward were becoming more and more a part
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1377,of this dear home where she had always been
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1378,the only cat.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1379,Soon Checkers came pattering down the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1380,stairs.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1381,"""Edward has found an office,."" he"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1382,"announced to Jenny. ""It's in a closet, behind"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1383,the Captain's rubber boots.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1384,Behind the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1385,Captain's rubber boots!
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1386,Jenny gulped .... That was a place
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1387,where she liked to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1388,doze on rainy days.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1389,And it was raining
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1390,now.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1391,The storm which Edward predicted had
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1392,burst on the garden.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1393,"""How dark the garden looks!"" exclaimed"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1394,"Checkers. ""It's as black as night. I guess I'll"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1395,"take a nap."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1396,"Without asking Jenny's permission, he"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1397,climbed into the Captain's armchair and fell
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1398,asleep.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1399,Jenny wished that Checkers had chosen
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1400,another place for his nap.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1401,"""I know he's tired,"" she thought crossly."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1402,"""But I'm the only cat who has ever slept in"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1403,"Captain Tinker's armchair."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1404,Then she wondered what Edward was
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1405,"doing: ""I bet he isn't writing at all. I bet he's"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1406,"snoozing."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1407,Jenny tiptoed up the stairs. As she passed
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1408,"Edward's office in the closet, she could hear"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1409,the sound of heavy breathing mingled with
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1410,delicate snores.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1411,"""Just what I thought,"" she told herself."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1412,"""Well, if everyone else can take a nap, I have"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1413,a right to take one too. Maybe I'll feel better
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1414,"after it."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1415,"Jenny went into the Captain's bedroom,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1416,crawled into her basket and fell sound asleep.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1417,"When she awakened at supper time, she felt"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1418,rested and cheerful.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1419,"""From now on I'll share everything with"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1420,"Checkers and Edward,"" she decided as she"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1421,went down the stairs.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1422,"But when she entered the living room, her"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1423,heart turned cold with jealousy.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1424,Captain Tinker was sitting in his
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1425,armchair. On one of his knees sat Checkers. On
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1426,"the other knee sat Edward wearing a new,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1427,red leather collar!
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1428,Jenny rushed toward her brothers.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1429,"""The Captain's knees belong to me,"" she"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1430,"cried. ""Get down!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1431,Checkers and Edward jumped quickly to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1432,"the floor. Then the Captain picked up Jenny,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1433,"stroked her cheek and said, ""Jenny, don't be"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1434,jealous of your brothers. I love you just as
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1435,"much as ever."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1436,But Jenny was too upset to believe him.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1437,Before she knew what she was doing she had
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1438,"scratched the Captain's hand. Then,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1439,"frightened by her awful deed, she fled to a safe"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1440,place beneath the sofa.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1441,Captain Tinker did not call after her or
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1442,"scold her. Instead, he walked quietly into the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1443,"kitchen and washed the scratch. Next, he"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1444,opened the door of the icebox. Jenny could
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1445,"hear him take out the supper food, warm it"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1446,and fill the three plates on her tray. After
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1447,"that, he returned to his workshop in the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1448,cellar.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1449,"""I know why the Captain has left me,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1450,"thought Jenny. ""He wants me to make"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1451,friends with my brothers. But I won't do it.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1452,Maybe I shall never speak to them again.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1453,"Anyway, I'll let them eat their supper by"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1454,"themselves."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1455,"She listened, but could not hear Checkers"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1456,and Edward go into the kitchen. She could
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1457,not hear them in the living room. Fear
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1458,gripped her heart. Perhaps she'd been so
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1459,horrid that her brothers had run off to find
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1460,another home.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1461,Jenny rushed into the kitchen. The
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1462,"brothers were not there, and they had not touched"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1463,their supper.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1464,She rushed upstairs and could not find
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1465,them anywhere.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1466,She ran downstairs and jumped onto the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1467,shelf.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1468,Checkers' red retrieving ball was gone!
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1469,"""That's it,"" she moaned. ""He's taken his"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1470,ball and run off with Edward. And on a night
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1471,"like this! Why, they may die of cold and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1472,"hunger. I'll go after them, and I won't come"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1473,"home until I've found them."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1474,Jenny dashed out into the rain. She
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1475,"splashed across the garden, climbed over"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1476,the fence and ran down the alley into South
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1477,Street. There she could not tell which way to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1478,turn. The rain had washed away all traces of
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1479,her brothers' paws.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1480,"She decided to turn to the right, and ran"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1481,"through swirling puddles, while the rain"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1482,drenched her back and filled her ears. On
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1483,"and on she ran, looking in every doorway."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1484,But she could not find her brothers.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1485,At last she felt that she was running the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1486,"wrong way. She stopped and asked herself,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1487,"""Where would I go on a rainy night, if I"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1488,"were homeless? I'd go to the fish shop, and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1489,"wait in the doorway, and hope that in the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1490,morning someone would give me some fish
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1491,"for breakfast."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1492,"Jenny turned back on her trail, and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1493,worked her way through the soaking rain
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1494,"until she reached the fish shop. There,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1495,"huddled in the doorway, sat her brothers."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1496,"""Checkers! Edward!"" she cried. ""I've"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1497,been mean and selfish. Please forgive me and

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1502,"""I do want you,"" she protested."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1503,"""Do you love us?"" asked Checkers."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1504,"""With all my heart,"" she cried. ""To prove"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1505,"how much I love you, I'll let you and Edward"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1506,sleep every night in my own basket in the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1507,"Captain's bedroom. I'll sleep in the cellar."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1508,"""Jenny, that proves you really love us,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1509,"declared Edward. ""We'll go home with you."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1510,But we won't take your basket. We'll sleep in
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1511,"the cellar."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1512,"""No, I'll sleep in the cellar,"" Jenny said."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1513,"""No, we will,"" said the brothers."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1514,"""I will,"" insisted Jenny. Then she added"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1515,"quickly, ""Let's not argue now, for we should"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1516,hurry home. I want to find the Captain and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1517,beg him to forgive me for scratching his
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1518,"hand."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1519,Jenny and her brothers ran home through
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1520,the rain. When they reached the house they
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1521,found the Captain waiting anxiously for
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1522,"them, with bath towels to rub them dry."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1523,As he rubbed Jenny's fur she tucked her
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1524,"chin in the hand she had scratched, and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1525,begged him to forgive her.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1526,"""Oh, that was just a little scratch,"" said"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1527,"Captain Tinker. ""You made up for it when"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1528,you ran out into the rainy night to find your
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1529,"brothers."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1530,Then Jenny tried to tell the Captain about
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1531,"the sleeping basket. But he said briskly, ""Go"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1532,"now and eat your supper."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1533,So she went into the kitchen with Checkers
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1534,"and Edward, and ate supper."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1535,"After that, the Captain said to her, ""It's"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1536,"very late, and time for all good cats to be in"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1537,"bed. Come, see what I have built for your"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1538,"two brothers."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1539,Jenny and her brothers followed Captain
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1540,Tinker up the stairs. In the room next to his
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1541,bedroom stood two little bunks that he had
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1542,built one above the other. Each bunk had a
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1543,warm red blanket on it.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1544,"""Now no one will have to sleep in the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1545,"cellar,"" cried Jenny happily, while her brothers"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1546,rubbed their backs against the Captain's legs
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1547,and thanked him.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1548,"Checkers chose the upper bunk, Edward"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1549,"climbed into the lower one, and everybody"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1550,said good night .
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1551,Jenny crawled into her basket in the next
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1552,"room, and the Captain went downstairs to"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1553,"smoke his pipe. Outside, the rain beat at the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1554,window panes.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1555,"""It's good to be indoors on such a night,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1556,"thought Jenny, with a yawn."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1557,She closed her eyes but could not go to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1558,"sleep, for she kept worrying about her"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1559,brothers. It would be terrible if they had run away
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1560,again.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1561,After a time Jenny crept into her brothers'
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1562,room. She found that Checkers had come
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1563,into the lower bunk and cuddled in Edward's
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1564,arms.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1565,How peacefully the brothers slept! The
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1566,"longer Jenny watched them, the happier she"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1567,felt. She also felt that someone should be
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1568,thanked for all this happiness. So she went
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1569,downstairs and said good night again to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1570,Captain Tinker.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1571,HOW THE BROTHERS JOINED THE CAT CLUB
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1572,FOR TWO NIGHTS AND DAYS it
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1573,"had rained on Captain Tinker's garden, and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1574,the cats who lived around the garden had to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1575,stay indoors.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1576,From time to time they pulled aside the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1577,curtains at their windows and stared at the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1578,Captain's house. They all felt something
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1579,strange had happened there. Just what it
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1580,"was, they did not know."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1581,"Inside the Captain's house, the little black"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1582,"cat, Jenny Linsky, looked out on the rainy"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1583,"garden and thought gloomily, ""Things"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1584,might be easier if it rained forever. Then I
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1585,wouldn't have to decide what to do about the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1586,"Cat Club meeting."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1587,"Jenny's two new brothers, Checkers and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1588,"Edward, came downstairs to play with her."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1589,"""Keep away from the window,"" she cried"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1590,"quickly. ""All the other cats are looking at"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1591,"our house."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1592,"""Jenny, what's the matter?"" asked the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1593,"younger brother, Checkers. ""Why don't you"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1594,want the other cats to know you rescued
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1595,Edward and me from the rain? Why don't you
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1596,want your friends to know that Captain
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1597,Tinker has adopted us? Don't you love us
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1598,"any more?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1599,"""You're the nicest brothers anyone ever"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1600,"had,"" replied Jenny. ""Everything I have"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1601,inside this house is yours as much as mine. But
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1602,"after the rain stops, something special is"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1603,going to happen in the garden. It's
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1604,"something I must decide about."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1605,"Jenny sounded so unhappy that Edward,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1606,"the older brother, said, ""Come on, Checkers."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1607,It's time for you and me to go upstairs again.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1608,"I have to continue my writing, and you"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1609,"should practice retrieving your red ball."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1610,Checkers jumped onto the shelf and took
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1611,his red retrieving ball from the glass bowl
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1612,where he kept it. He grasped the ball
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1613,between his teeth and followed Edward up the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1614,stairs.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1615,Jenny looked out again on the rainy
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1616,garden. The rain was stopping.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1617,"""Tonight the moon will come up,"" she"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1618,"thought. ""And the Cat Club will meet"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1619,beneath the maple tree. But I can't - I really
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1620,can't tell my brothers about it. I'll steal out
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1621,"and go to the meeting all alone."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1622,"As Jenny was usually very generous, she"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1623,felt sorry about not taking her brothers to the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1624,meeting.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1625,"""Why is it,"" she wondered, ""that I don't"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1626,want Checkers and Edward to belong to the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1627,"Cat Club? They're part of my family now,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1628,and I should share my good times with them.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1629,But at the Cat Club I can be different than
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1630,"I am at home, just because my family isn't"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1631,around. No one here at home - not even
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1632,Captain Tinker - would ever guess the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1633,"things I've done at the Club."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1634,Jenny had done many good deeds at the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1635,"Club, and some of them had required"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1636,courage. She remembered the night when she had
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1637,braved a gang of wicked dogs in order to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1638,carry a flute to a sick member of the Club.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1639,Another night Jenny a led the entire
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1640,Cat Club in its parade to the park for the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1641,Annual Spring Picnic.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1642,THE DUKE

L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1650,CONCERTINA
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1651,MADAME BUTTERFLY
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1652,MR. PRESIDENT
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1653,This chart shows the order in which the members of the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1654,Cat Club marched behind Jenny in the Picnic Parade.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1655,"The more Jenny thought about it, the more"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1656,"amazed she grew that she, who was so small"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1657,"and shy and black, had been able to do such"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1658,"glorious deeds. ""And I've done them, all"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1659,"alone, with no one to help me,"" she said to"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1660,"herself, rather proudly."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1661,"A that moment Jenny's master, the old"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1662,"sea captain, Captain Tinker, came into the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1663,room. He held in his hand the bright red
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1664,scarf had knit for Jenny long ago. One of
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1665,"the tassels had come loose, and he had just"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1666,sewn it on.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1667,The Captain was about to hang the scarf
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1668,on its hook when he caught Jenny's eye.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1669,Suddenly she realized that what she had been
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1670,thinking wasn't quite true. She hadn't done
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1671,"her brave deeds, all alone."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1672,"And she thought to herself, ""Without that"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1673,"scarf to protect me, I wouldn't have even"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1674,dared to join the Cat Club. Captain Tinker
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1675,"helped me when he gave me the scarf, and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1676,I should help my brothers so they can get
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1677,"their share of fun. But it won't be easy."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1678,"Jenny looked at Captain Tinker, and he"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1679,could tell from her worried yellow eyes that
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1680,she had something difficult to do.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1681,He tied the scarf around her neck and said
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1682,"gently, ""Brave deeds can be done at home"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1683,"as well as in the world outside."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1684,Then he returned to his workshop in the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1685,cellar.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1686,"Jenny tucked her chin in the scarf, and the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1687,scarf gave her courage.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1688,"""I'll take my brothers with me to the Cat"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1689,"Club,"" she decided. ""Even if it spoils a little"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1690,"of my fun, I'll do it."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1691,"Now that she'd made up her mind, Jenny"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1692,felt much better.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1693,She went upstairs to find her brothers.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1694,Jenny found Checkers practicing his
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1695,retrieving in the hall. Retrieving his little
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1696,red ball was a trick Edward had taught
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1697,him while they were wandering homeless
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1698,"through the wide, wide world, before they"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1699,came to live with Jenny.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1700,Checkers had chosen one corner of the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1701,hall for his home base. He would stand on
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1702,"the home base, bat the ball down the hall"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1703,"with his paw, chase the ball, pick it up with"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1704,his teeth and carry it back to the base.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1705,Chasing the ball and bringing it back was called
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1706,"""retrieving."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1707,Jenny loved to watch her black and white
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1708,"brother retrieve, but right now she had other"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1709,things to do.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1710,"""Checkers,"" she said, ""I'm sorry I was"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1711,cross with you downstairs. I was busy
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1712,making up my mind about our Cat Club. Most
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1713,all the cats who live near here belong to it.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1714,"We'll meet tonight, and you and Edward"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1715,must go with me to the meeting. I'll ask if
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1716,"you may join the Club."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1717,"""Is it hard to join?"" asked Checkers."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1718,"""Quite hard,"" admitted Jenny. ""No one is"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1719,allowed to become a member unless he can
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1720,do a special trick. You'll get in all right
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1721,"because of your retrieving trick."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1722,"""And Edward's trick can be his writing,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1723,said Checkers.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1724,"""Yes,"" agreed Jenny, ""writing will be"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1725,"Edward's special trick."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1726,But suddenly an awful thought occurred
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1727,to her: what if Edward couldn't write?
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1728,It was true he'd found an office for
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1729,"himself in a corner of the closet, behind Captain"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1730,Tinker's rubber boots. Edward had spent
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1731,many hours in his new office. But maybe he
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1732,had only been sleeping there. So far he hadn't
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1733,shown Jenny anything he'd written.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1734,"""Checkers,"" she said, ""I'm afraid we'd"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1735,"better speak to Edward."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1736,The two cats poked their noses into the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1737,closet where their older brother (a gentle cat
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1738,with handsome tiger stripes) was lying
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1739,comfortably behind the Captain's boots.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1740,"""Edward,"" said Jenny, ""excuse us for"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1741,bothering you. I'm sure you're very busy.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1742,"But there's something you should know."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1743,Edward looked up from the floor.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1744,"""It's about our Cat Club,"" continued"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1745,"Jenny. ""We meet whenever there's a moon,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1746,"and there will be a moon tonight."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1747,Edward's soft eyes brightened.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1748,"""We have a President, a"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1749,Secretary and eleven
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1750,"regular members,"" explained"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1751,"Jenny. ""Our motto is"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1752,"Loyalty, Fidelity, Truth and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1753,Dues. I hope you and Checkers will be
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1754,"allowed to join the Club."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1755,"""Thank you,"" said Edward. ""It sounds"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1756,"very exciting."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1757,"""But you must be able to do a special"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1758,"trick,"" continued Jenny. ""Checkers, of"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1759,"course, can retrieve. When I joined the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1760,"Club, Captain Tinker made me some ice"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1761,"skates and I skated. If it were winter now,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1762,"instead of spring, I'd lend my skates to you."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1763,"""Skating is your trick, not mine,"" said"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1764,"Edward. ""Mine must be my writing."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1765,"Jenny said, ""Would you have a piece of"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1766,"writing you could read to us, just to see if"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1767,"it's the kind of thing the Cat Club likes?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1768,"""I haven't had time to do any real"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1769,"writing,"" admitted Edward. ""But I've been"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1770,thinking about a poem I'd like to write some
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1771,day. It would begin like this:
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1772,"""I'd love to be a butterfly"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1773,"Flying high -flying high."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1774,Edward stopped and looked up hopefully.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1775,"""What do you think?"" he asked."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1776,"Jenny thought to herself, ""I think it's"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1777,awful. But I can't tell him so. I'd hurt his
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1778,"feelings."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1779,"""Please tell me the truth,"" he begged."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1780,Poor Jenny said nothing. The truth was
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1781,too hard for her to tell.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1782,"But the word ""truth"" kept running"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1783,through her mind. Where had she heard the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1784,"word before? Loyalty, Fidelity, Truth and"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1785,Dues. It was the third word in the Cat Club
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1786,motto.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1787,So she decided to tell Edward the truth.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1788,And she realized it would be better for him
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1789,"to learn it now, when it might help him. She"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1790,"would try to tell it nicely, so he wouldn't feel"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1791,too hurt.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1792,"""Edward,"" she said bravely, ""the Cat Club"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1793,is tough. Most of the members are older than
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1794,"you, and they might think your poem is"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1795,babyish. You should give them something
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1796,scary. Something that will make their fur
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1797,stand up. Something that will make their
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1798,"whiskers twitch - and shiver."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1799,"""Shiver their whiskers,"" murmured"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1800,"Edward. ""H'm. I know the poem to write."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1801,A faraway look crept into Edward's face.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1802,"He hunched his shoulders, and the claws of"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1803,his right paw scratched the floor. Edward
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1804,was writing!
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1805,Jenny went downstairs with Checkers and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1806,they jumped onto the sofa.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1807,"""Jenny,"" said Checkers, ""you must be"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1808,tired after all you've done. Let's take naps
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1809,"and get rested for the meeting."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1810,"They snuggled together, and while they"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1811,"slept, Jenny had a terrible dream about"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1812,Edward's not being allowed to join the Cat
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1813,Club. She waked up with a start and found
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1814,the sun was shining brightly.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1815,"Checkers waked, too, and went upstairs."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1816,"He came down immediately and said,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1817,"""Edward is still writing. He'll see us at supper."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1818,When Edward heard Captain Tinker
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1819,"rattling the supper dishes, he came downstairs."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1820,"""Did you write a scary poem?"" asked"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1821,Jenny.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1822,"""Shiver my whiskers! I did,"" he declared."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1823,"""But it would be bad luck for me to tell you"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1824,"what it is before the Club meeting."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1825,After supper the three cats got ready for
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1826,"the meeting. With licks of their pink tongues,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1827,they washed their furry coats and smoothed
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1828,their whiskers.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1829,"When the moon shone on the garden,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1830,"things began to happen. Bushes stirred,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1831,shadows moved across the grass. Jenny
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1832,"stood watching at the window, while her"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1833,brothers sat near her on the floor.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1834,"""I'll keep you a secret till the meeting gets"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1835,"started,"" she said. ""Rough cats like Sinbad"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1836,and The Duke can think up lots of trouble
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1837,THE DUKE
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1838,SINBAD
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1839,if they have too much time for thinking.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1840,"Those two are coming now."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1841,Other cats were also rushing to the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1842,"meeting. Jenny named them: the twins, Romulus"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1843,"and Remus; Solomon, the wizened wise cat"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1844,who accompanied the President's young
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1845,"nephew, Junior; the sweethearts, Arabella"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1846,"and Antonio; the fancy dancer, Macaroni;"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1847,"and the fluffy Madame Butterfly, who could"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1848,play sweet music; on a nose flute.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1849,"""There goes our Secretary, Concertina,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1850,"whispered Jenny. ""She's climbing up the"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1851,"maple tree, where she scratches records of"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1852,our meetings. Everybody's there except Mr.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1853,President. Oh! He's coming now. Let's start.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1854,"Checkers, have you your retrieving ball?"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1855,And don't forget you're to wait with Edward
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1856,"in the bushes till I call you."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1857,Jenny gave one last anxious look at
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1858,"Edward, who was nervously muttering his"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1859,poem. Then she jumped into the garden. Her
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1860,"brothers followed, and while they crawled"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1861,"into the bushes, Jenny sped to the meeting."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1862,She arrived just as it opened.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1863,"""Does anyone have any special business"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1864,"to discuss?"" asked Mr. President."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1865,Jenny waved a small black paw.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1866,"He said, ""Jenny, name your business."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1867,"Her heart thumped as she began: ""Mr."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1868,"President, I have two wonderful new"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1869,"brothers. Their names are Checkers and Edward."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1870,All eyes stared at Jenny. So that was what
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1871,had been happening in her house. New
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1872,brothers. Two of them!
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1873,"""Please, Mr. President,"" she continued."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1874,"""May my brothers join this noble Cat Club?"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1875,"They're waiting in the bushes."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1876,"""Bring forth the brothers,"" ordered Mr."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1877,President.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1878,Jenny ran to the bushes and returned with
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1879,her brother. The members gave Checkers
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1880,"a friendly nod, because his red retrieving"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1881,ball looked so exciting. But Edward seemed
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1882,like such a gentlemanly cat that Sinbad and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1883,The Duke began to giggle.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1884,"""Silence,"" commanded Mr. President."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1885,"""Checkers and Edward shall be discussed in"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1886,alphabetical order. C. comes before E. Will
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1887,"C. step forward?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1888,Checkers picked up his red ball and went
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1889,before Mr. President. Mr. President asked
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1890,him his name and where he lived. Checkers
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1891,"answered in a clear, sweet voice."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1892,"Next Mr . President asked him, ""Can you"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1893,"do anything?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1894,"""I can retrieve,"" answered Checkers."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1895,"Checkers rolled his ball to Jenny, who"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1896,batted it with her paw across the moonlit
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1897,"grass. He dashed after it, brought it back"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1898,and laid it before Mr. President.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1899,No one had ever seen such fine retrieving.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1900,The members raised their paws and voted
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1901,Checkers into the Club.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1902,"As Checkers returned to his seat, Jenny"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1903,"made a silent prayer: ""Please may Edward"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1904,"pass his test, too."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1905,Then Edward was called before Mr.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1906,"President, who asked him the usual"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1907,"questions: name, address and what he could do."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1908,"To this last question Edward answered, ""I"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1909,"can write."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1910,"""Please read a writing,"" said Mr."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1911,President.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1912,"Edward said, ""I shall recite a poem."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1913,"""A poem!"" shouted The Duke. ""Who"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1914,"wants to hear a sissy poem?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1915,This rudeness startled Edward. His voice
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1916,"left him. Standing alone in the ring, he looked"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1917,so helpless that Jenny was frightened.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1918,After a long time Edward stammered in a
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1919,"little, tiny voice, ""I am a ghost."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1920,"A ghost! Though he had said it softly,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1921,Jenny and the other members caught the
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1922,scary word. Their fur stood up. Their
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1923,whiskers twitched - and shivered! Sinbad and
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1924,"The Duke called out to Edward, ""Louder,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1925,"please! And start again!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1926,"This time, in a stronger voice, Edward"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1927,"said, ""A Poem by Edward Brandywine"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1928,A POEM
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1929,BY
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1930,EDWARD BRANDYWINE
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1931,I am a ghost.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1932,"Though I don't want to boast,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1933,I'm the ghost of a pirate cat -
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1934,That's that.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1935,"In times gone by,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1936,"Oh me, oh my!"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1937,In another life
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1938,I carried a knife
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1939,With a pointed tip
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1940,At my snarling lip
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1941,And sailed on a ship
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1942,With a sword at my hip
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1943,As a pirate cat -
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1944,That's that.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1945,With a hearty meow
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1946,I'd leap from the prow
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1947,To another ship's deck
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1948,And there I'd wreck
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1949,All cats on board
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1950,With my trusty sword
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1951,And the knife from my lip
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1952,And the tigerish skip
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1953,Of a pirate cat -
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1954,That's that.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1955,As time flew by
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1956,My crimes piled high.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1957,But what did I care
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1958,As I sailed here and there
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1959,"Till, alas! I was caught."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1960,What a battle I fought!
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1961,But they whisked me apart
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1962,"And pickled my heart,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1963,And my life on a ship
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1964,With a knife at my lip
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1965,As a pirate cat
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1966,Fell flat.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1967,"Now in olden times, when this tale"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1968,"took place,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1969,A wicked cat was granted a grace:
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1970,Nine lives had he -
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1971,Nine chances to be
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1972,"A good, respectable cat."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1973,"So here at last,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1974,"With my crimes long past,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1975,I stand expectant-ly.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1976,More tales I could tell
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1977,And they'd all sound well.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1978,A rhyming cat - that's me.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1979,Edward bowed graciously to indicate that
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1980,his poem was finished. Modestly he tried to
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1981,return to his seat. But the other cats were
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1982,"pushing toward him, cheering the great"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1983,"writer, Edward Brandywine. Immediately"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1984,they voted him into the Club.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1985,"""Speech, Edward! Speech!"" cried Sinbad,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1986,whose whiskers were still shivering with
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1987,excitement from the pirate poem.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1988,The Duke and the other members took up
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1989,"the cry: ""Speech, Edward! Speech!"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1990,Jenny gazed proudly at her brother
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1991,"Edward as he said, ""I wish to thank the Cat Club"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1992,"for the great honor it has paid me."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1993,"""How beautifully he speaks and writes,"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1994,thought Jenny.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1995,"Then she could hear Edward say, ""I also"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1996,"wish to thank my little sister, Jenny Linsky."
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1997,"If Jenny hadn't helped me, I could never"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1998,"have written my poem."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,1999,"""Me?"" wondered Jenny. ""What did I do?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,2000,"And Sinbad said to Edward, ""Tell us,"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,2001,"what did Jenny do?"""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,2002,Edward smiled.
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,2003,"""Jenny helped me find the proper kind of"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,2004,"poem to write,"" he answered. ""She told me I"
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,2005,"should make your whiskers shiver."""
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,2006,Someone with a heavy paw pushed Jenny
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,2007,through the crowd. She stood happily
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,2008,between her brothers while the Cat Club gave
L106,JENNY AND THE CAT CLUB,ESTHER AVERILL,2009,three cheers for Jenny Linsky.

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,1,THOMAS AND GORDON
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,2,Thomas was a tank engine who lived at a Big Station.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,3,"He had six small wheels, a short stumpy funnel, a short"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,4,"stumpy boiler, and a short stumpy dome."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,5,"He was a fussy little engine, always pulling coaches about."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,6,He pulled them to the station ready for the big engines to take
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,7,out on long journeys; and when trains came in and the people
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,8,"had got out, he would pull the empty coaches away so that the"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,9,big engines could go and rest.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,10,"He was a cheeky little engine, too. He thought no engine"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,11,worked as hard as he did. So he used to
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,12,play tricks on them. He liked best of all to
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,13,come quietly beside a big engine dozing
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,14,on a siding and make him jump.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,15,"""Peep, peep, peep, pip, peep! Wake up, lazybones!"" he would"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,17,Then he would laugh rudely and run away to find some
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,18,more coaches.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,19,"One day, Gordon was resting on a siding. He was very tired."

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,21,had to run as fast as he could to make up for lost time.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,22,He was just going to sleep when Thomas came up in his

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,24,"""Wake up, lazybones,"" he whistled. ""Do some hard work"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,30,"His fire went out, and there"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,48,"""Poop, poop,"" he whistled. ""Get in quickly, please."" So the"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,82,He went home very slowly and was careful afterwards never
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,83,to be cheeky to Gordon again.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,84,THOMAS' TRAIN

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,93,"Now Henry usually pulled the first train in the morning,"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,112,Thomas got more and more excited every minute.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,113,Sir Topham Hatt came out of his office to see what was the
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,114,"matter, and the Guard and the Station Master told him about"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,115,Henry.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,116,"""Find another engine,"" he ordered."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,117,"""There's only Thomas,"" they said."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,118,"""You'll have to do it, then, Thomas. Be quick now!"""
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,119,So Thomas ran round to the front and backed up to the
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,120,"coaches, ready to start."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,121,"""Don't be impatient,"" said his Driver. ""Wait till everything"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,122,"is ready."""
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,123,But Thomas was too excited to listen to a word he said.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,124,"What happened then, no one knows. Perhaps they forgot"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,125,"to couple Thomas to the train, perhaps Thomas was too"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,126,"impatient to wait till they were ready, or perhaps his Driver"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,127,pulled the lever by mistake.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,128,"Anyhow, Thomas started. People shouted and waved at"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,129,"him, but he didn't stop."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,130,"""They're waving because I'm such"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,131,"a splendid engine,"" he thought"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,133,"to pull trains, but I think it's easy."""
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,134,"""Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!"" he"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,135,"puffed, pretending to be like"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,137,"As he passed the first signal box, he"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,138,"saw the men leaning out, waving and"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,139,shouting.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,140,"""They're pleased to see me,"" he thought. ""They've never"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,142,"he whistled, ""Peep, peep, thank you,"" and hurried on."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,143,"But he came to a signal -- ""Danger."""
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,144,"""Bother!"" he thought. ""I must stop, and I was going so"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,145,"nicely, too. What a nuisance signals are!"" And he blew an"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,146,"angry ""peep, peep"" on his whistle."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,147,"One of the Signalmen ran up. ""Hullo, Thomas!"" he said."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,148,"""What are you doing here?"""
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,149,"""I'm pulling a train,"" said Thomas proudly. ""Can't you see?"""
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,150,"""Where are your coaches, then?"""
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,151,"Thomas looked back. ""Why, bless me,"" he said, ""if we"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,153,"""Yes,"" said the Signalmen, ""you'd better go back quickly"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,154,"and fetch them."""
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,155,Poor Thomas was so sad he nearly cried.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,156,"""Cheer up!"" said his Driver. ""Let's go back quickly and"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,157,"try again."""
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,158,"At the station, all the passengers were talking at once. They"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,160,Guard what a bad railway it was.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,161,"But when Thomas came back and they saw how sad he was,"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,162,"they couldn't be cross. So they coupled him to the train, and"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,163,this time he really pulled it.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,164,But for a long time afterwards the other engines laughed at
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,165,"Thomas, and said:"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,171,"The others didn't take much notice, for Thomas was a little"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,172,engine who talked big.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,173,"But one night, Edward came to the Shed. He was a kind"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,175,"""I've got some freight cars to take home tomorrow,"" he told"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,176,"him. ""If you take them instead, I'll push coaches in the Yard."""
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,177,"""Thank you,"" said Thomas, ""that will be nice."""

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,179,"they said ""Yes,"" Thomas ran happily to find the freight cars."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,180,"Now, freight cars are silly and noisy. They talk a lot and"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,181,don't attend to what they are doing. They don't listen to
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,182,"their engine, and when he stops, they bump into each other,"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,183,"screaming, ""Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Whatever is happening?"""
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,184,"And, I'm sorry to say, they play tricks on an engine who is"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,185,not used to them.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,186,Edward knew all about freight cars. He warned Thomas to
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,187,"be careful, but Thomas was too excited to listen."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,188,"The Switchman fastened the coupling, and when the signal"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,190,"The Guard blew his whistle. ""Peep! Peep!"" answered Thomas,"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,191,and started off.

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,193,"""Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!"" they screamed as their couplings"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,194,"tightened. ""Wait, Thomas, wait."" But Thomas wouldn't wait."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,195,"""Come-on. Come-on,"" he puffed, and the freight cars"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,196,grumbled slowly out of the siding onto the Main Line.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,197,"Thomas was happy. ""Come along. Come along,"" he puffed."

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,199,grumbled the freight cars. They clattered through stations and
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,200,rumbled over bridges.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,201,"Thomas whistled, ""Peep! Peep!"" and they rushed through the"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,202,tunnel in which Henry had been shut up.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,203,Then they came to the top of the hill where Gordon had

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,205,"""Steady now, steady,"" warned the Driver, and he shut off"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,207,"""We're stopping, we're stopping,"" called Thomas."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,208,"""No! No! No! No!"" answered the"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,214,laughing behind him.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,215,Poor Thomas tried hard to stop

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,217,"""Stop pushing, stop pushing,"" he hissed, but the freight cars"
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,218,would not stop.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,219,"""Go -- on! -- Go -- on!"" they giggled in their silly way."
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,220,He was glad when they got to the bottom. Then
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,221,he saw the place where they had to stop.

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,223,"They rattled through the station, and luckily the line was"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,225,"""Oo-----ooh e-----r,"" groaned Thomas as"

L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,320,Thomas helped him back to the Shed.
L108,THOMAS THE TANK ENGINE: THE VERY FIRST STORIES,REVEREND W AWDRY,321,Sir Topham Hatt was waiting anxiously for them.

L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,1,[[This looks like an
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,2,ordinary box full of ordinary yarn.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,3,But it turns out it isn't.]]
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,4,"On a cold afternoon in a cold little town,"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,5,where everywhere you looked was either the white of snow
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,6,"or the black of soot from chimneys,"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,7,Annabelle found a box filled with yarn of every color.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,8,So she went home and 
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,9,knit herself a sweater.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,10,"And when Annabelle was done, she had "
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,11,some extra yarn.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,12,"So she knit a sweater for Mars, too."
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,13,But there was still extra yarn.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,14,And when Annabelle and Mars went 
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,15,"for a walk, Nate pointed and laughed"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,16,"and said, 'You two look ridiculous.'"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,17,"'You're just jealous,'"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,18,said Annabelle.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,19,"'No, I'm not,' said Nate."
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,20,But it turned out he was.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,21,And even after she'd made a sweater for Nate
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,22,"and his dog, and for herself and for Mars,"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,23,she still had extra yarn.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,24,"At school, Annabelle's classmates could"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,25,not stop talking about her sweater.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,26,'Quiet!' shouted Mr. Norman.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,27,"'Quiet, everyone! Annabelle,"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,28,that sweater of yours is a terrible 
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,29,distraction. I cannot teach with 
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,30,everyone turning around to look
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,31,at you!'
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,32,"'Then I'll knit one for everyone,'"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,33,"Annabelle said, 'so they won't"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,34,have to turn around.'
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,35,'Impossible!' said Mr. Norman.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,36,'You can't.'
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,37,But it turned out she could. And she did.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,38,Even for Mr. Norman.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,39,"And when she was done, Annabelle still had extra yarn."
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,40,So she knit sweaters for her mom and dad.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,41,And for Mr. Pendleton
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,42,and Mrs. Pendleton.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,43,And for Dr. Palmer.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,44,And for little Louis. 
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,45,"She made sweaters for everyone, except"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,46,"Mr. Crabtree, who never wore sweaters or"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,47,"even long pants, and who would stand in "
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,48,his shorts with the snow up to his knees.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,49,"'No sweater for me, thanks,' said Mr. Crabtree."
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,50,So she made Mr. Crabtree a hat.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,51,And even then Annabelle still
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,52,had extra yarn.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,53,"She made sweaters for all the dogs,"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,54,"and all the cats,"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,55,"and for other animals, too."
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,56,"Soon, people thought, soon Annabelle will run out of yarn."
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,57,But it turned out she didn't.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,58,So Annabelle made sweaters for things 
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,59,that didn't even wear sweaters.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,60,Things began to change
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,61,in that little town. 
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,62,News spread of this remarkable girl who never ran out of yarn.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,63,"And people came to visit from around the world, to see all the sweaters"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,64,and to shake Annabelle's hand.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,65,"One day an archduke, who was very fond of clothes,"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,66,sailed across the sea and demanded to see Annabelle.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,67,"'Little girl,' said the archduke. 'I would like to buy that miraculous"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,68,box of yarn. And I am willing to offer you one million dollars.'
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,69,"'No, thank you,' said Annabelle, who "
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,70,was knitting a sweater for a pickup truck.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,71,The archduke's mustache twitched.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,72,"'Two million,' he said."
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,73,Annabelle shook her head.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,74,'No thanks.'
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,75,'Ten million!' shouted the
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,76,archduke. 'Take it or leave it!'
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,77,"'Leave it,' said Annabelle."
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,78,'I won't sell the yarn.'
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,79,And she didn't.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,80,So that night the archduke hired three robbers
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,81,"to break into Annabelle's house,"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,82,and they stole the box
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,83,"and took it to the archduke,"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,84,"who set off across the snow,"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,85,"and sailed over the sea,"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,86,back to his castle.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,87,The archduke put on his favorite song
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,88,and sat in his best chair.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,89,"Then he took out the box,"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,90,"and he lifted its lid, and he looked inside."
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,91,His mustache quivered.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,92,It shivered.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,93,It trembled.
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,94,The archduke hurled the box out
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,95,"the window and shouted,"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,96,"'Little girl, I curse you with"
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,97,my family's curse!
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,98,You will never be happy again!'
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,99,But
L109,EXTRA YARN,MAC BARNETT,100,it turned out she was. 
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,1,This is Square.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,2,This is Square's secret cave.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,3,"Every day, Square goes down into his cave"
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,4,and takes a block from the pile below the ground.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,5,He pushes the block up and out of the cave.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,6,He brings the block to the pile at the top of hill.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,7,This is his work.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,8,"One day while Square was doing his work,"
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,9,Circle floated by.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,10,'Square!' said Circle. 'You are a genius!
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,11,I did not know you were a sculptor!'
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,12,"'Ah, yes,' said Square. 'What is a sculptor?'"
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,13,"'A sculptor shapes blocks into art,' said Circle."
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,14,"'Ah, yes,' said Square. 'I see what you mean.'"
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,15,But he did not really see what she meant.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,16,"'This is a wonderful sculpture,' said Circle."
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,17,'It looks just like you!'
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,18,Square looked at his block.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,19,"'Yes, I suppose it is wonderful.'"
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,20,"'Now,' said Circle, 'you must do one of me.'"
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,21,"'Oh,' said Square."
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,22,"'I will come back for it tomorrow! Good-bye, genius!'"
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,23,"'Circle,' said Square, 'I think I should tell you something.'"
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,24,But she was already gone.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,25,"'Oh dear dear dear,' said Square."
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,26,He studied the block.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,27,'I have to make this block look
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,28,"like Circle,' he said."
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,29,'Circle is perfect. So I must
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,30,make this perfect.'
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,31,Square got to work shaping the block.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,32,'Oh crumbs!' said Square. 'This is not perfect!'
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,33,'Oh dirt!' said Square. 'This is much worse.'
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,34,He went back to work.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,35,He worked and worked
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,36,and worked and worked.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,37,'AAAH!' cried Square.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,38,He had carved the whole block away.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,39,There was nothing left.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,40,He was surrounded by rubble.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,41,"'Whatever is the opposite of perfect,"
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,42,that is what this is! I must stay up
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,43,all night and figure this out!'
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,44,Square fell asleep.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,45,"The next morning,"
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,46,Square woke up wet.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,47,He despaired.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,48,'What have I done?
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,49,I push blocks.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,50,I do not shape them.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,51,I am not a genius.'
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,52,"'Hello, genius!' said Circle. 'I am early!'"
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,53,"'Oh dear,' whispered Square."
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,54,'Are you finished?' asked Circle.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,55,"'Oh yes,' said Square. 'I am finished.'"
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,56,Circle peered down.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,57,"'Oh my,' she said."
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,58,It was beautiful.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,59,It was beguiling.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,60,"'It is perfect,' said Circle."
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,61,'It is?' asked Square.
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,62,"'Yes,' said Circle."
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,63,"'You are a genius,' said Circle."
L110,SQUARE,MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,64,But was he really?
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,1,This is Triangle.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,2,This is Triangle's house.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,3,This is Triangle in his house.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,4,And that is Triangle's door.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,5,One day Triangle walked out his door
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,6,and away from his house.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,7,He was going to play a sneaky trick on Square.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,8,He walked past small triangles
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,9,and medium triangles and big triangles.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,10,He walked past shapes
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,11,that weren't triangles anymore. 
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,12,They were shapes
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,13,with no names.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,14,He walked until he got to a place
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,15,where there were squares.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,16,"Still thinking of his sneaky trick,"
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,17,he walked past big squares
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,18,and medium squares and small squares
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,19,until he got to Square's house.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,20,"'Now,' said Triangle,"
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,21,'I will play my sneaky trick.'
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,22,Triangle walked up to Square's door
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,23,and said 'HISS!' just like a snake.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,24,Square was afraid of snakes.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,25,'Oh me oh my!' said Square.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,26,"'Go away, you snake! Leave my door!'"
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,27,'HISS!' said Triangle. 'HISS! HISS! HISS!'
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,28,'Oh dear dear dear!' said Square.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,29,'How many snakes are out there? Ten?
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,30,"Ten million? Go away, snakes!'"
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,31,Triangle could not hiss anymore.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,32,He was laughing too hard.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,33,'Triangle!' said Square. 'Is that you?'
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,34,'Yes!' said Triangle. 'I know you are afraid of 
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,35,snakes. I have played a sneaky trick on you!'
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,36,"Square ran after Triangle, past small squares"
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,37,and medium squares and big squares.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,38,He ran past the shapes
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,39,"with no names,"
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,40,past the big triangles
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,41,"and medium triangles and small triangles,"
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,42,up to Triangle's house and right through his door.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,43,Almost.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,44,'You are stuck!' Triangle laughed and laughed.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,45,Then he stopped. His house was all dark.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,46,Triangle was afraid of the dark.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,47,'It's too dark!' said Triangle. 'You're blocking
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,48,"my light! Go away, you block! Leave my door!"
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,49,It was Square's turn to laugh.
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,50,'I know you are afraid of the dark. Now I have
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,51,"played a sneaky trick on you! You see, Triangle,"
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,52,this was my plan all along.'
L111,TRIANGLE (SHAPE TRILOGY),MAC BARNETT AND JON KLASSEN,53,But do you really believe him?

L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,3,A slow loris is just a type of animal.
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,4,Slow Loris was a slow loris.
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,5,He really was...very...slow.
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,6,It took Loris ten minutes to eat a satsuma...
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,7,twenty minutes to get from one end of his branch
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,8,to the other...
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,9,and an hour to scratch his bottom.
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,10,"Most of the time though he just hung around, sleeping."
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,11,The visitors all thought Loris was boring.
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,12,The other animals thought so too.
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,13,But he didn't care.
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,14,Loris had a secret.
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,15,"At night, when all the other animals were sound asleep,"
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,16,Loris got up and did things...
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,17,FAST...
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,18,Until he was so tired he couldn't do another thing.
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,19,One night when Loris was busy doing particularly noisy things...
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,20,[[BANG]] [[BANG]] [[BANG]]
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,21,News of Loris's secret life spread quickly.
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,22,Next evening the whole zoo gathered outside the slow loris cage.
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,23,"Sure enough, when it was really dark..."
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,24,out came Loris.
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,25,The other animals were amazed. Loris wasn't boring at all. He was really wild.
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,26,That night they all did things together...
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,27,"until they were all so tired, not one of them could do another thing."
L144,SLOW LORIS,ALEXIS DEACON,28,"The next day all the animals were slow. 'Boring,' said the visitors. But, like Loris, they didn't care, now they had a secret too."

L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,11,"""The Big Bad Mouse is terribly strong"
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,12,and his scaly tail is terribly long.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,13,His eyes are like pools of terrible fire
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,14,"And his terrible whiskers are tougher than wire."""
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,15,"One snowy night when the Gruffalo snored,"
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,16,The Gruffalo's Child was feeling bored.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,17,The Gruffalo's Child was feeling brave
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,18,so she tiptoed out of the gruffalo cave.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,19,The snow fell fast and the wind blew wild.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,20,Into the wood went the Gruffalo's Child.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,21,Aha! Oho! A trail in the snow!
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,22,Whose is this trail and where does it go?
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,23,A tail poked out of a logpile house.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,24,Could this be the tail of the Big Bad Mouse?
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,25,Out slid the creature. His eyes were small
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,26,"And he didn't have whiskers- no, none at all."
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,27,"""You're not the Mouse."""
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,28,"""Not I,"" said the snake."
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,29,"""He's down by the lake- eating gruffalo cake."""
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,30,The snow fell fast and the wind blew wild.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,31,"""I'm not scared,"" said the Gruffalo's child."
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,32,Aha! Oho! Marks in the snow!
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,33,Whose are these claw marks? Where do they go?
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,34,Two eyes gleamed out of a treetop house.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,35,Could these be the eyes of the Big Bad Mouse?
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,36,Down flew the creature. His tail was short
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,37,And he didn't have whiskers of any sort.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,38,"""You're not the Mouse."""
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,39,"""Toowhoo, not I,"
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,40,"But he's somewhere nearby, eating gruffalo pie."""
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,41,The snow fell fast and the wind blew wild.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,42,"""I'm not scared,"" said the Gruffalo's Child."
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,43,Aha! Oho! A track in the snow!
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,44,Whose is this track and where does it go?
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,45,Whiskers at last! And an underground house!
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,46,(Could this be the home of the Big Bad Mouse?)
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,47,Out slunk a creature. His eyes weren't fiery.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,48,His tail wasn't scaly. His whiskers weren't wiry.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,49,"""You're not the Mouse."""
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,50,"""Oh no, not me."
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,51,"He's under a tree- drinking Gruffalo tea."""
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,52,"""It's all a trick!"" said the Gruffalo's Child"
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,53,as she sat on a stump where the snow lay piled.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,54,"""I don't believe in the Big Bad Mouse-"
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,55,"But here comes a little one, out of his house!"
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,56,"Not big, not bad, but a mouse at least-"
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,57,"You'll taste good as a midnight feast."""
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,58,"""Wait!"" said the mouse. ""Before you eat,"
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,59,There's a friend of mine that you ought to meet.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,60,If you let me hop onto a hazel twig
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,61,"I'll beckon my friend so bad and big."""
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,62,The Gruffalo's Child unclenched her fist.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,63,"""The Big Bad Mouse- so he does exist!"""
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,64,The mouse hopped into the hazel tree.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,65,"He beckoned and said, ""Just wait and see."""
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,66,Out came the moon. It was bright and round.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,67,A terrible shadow fell onto the ground.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,68,"Who is this creature so big, bad and strong?"
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,69,His tail and his whiskers are terribly long.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,70,"His ears are enormous, and over his shoulder"
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,71,he carries a nut as big as a boulder!
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,72,"""The Big Bad Mouse!"" yelled the Gruffalo's child."
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,73,The mouse jumped down from the twig and smiled.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,74,Aha! Oho! Prints in the snow.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,75,Whose are these footprints? Where do they go?
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,76,"The footprints led to the gruffalo cave,"
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,77,where the Gruffalo's Child was a bit less brave.
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,78,The Gruffalo's Child was a bit less bored-
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,79,and the Gruffalo snored 
L151,THE GRUFFALO'S CHILD,JULIA DONALDSON,80,and snored and snored.

L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,1,Once upon a time there 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,2,was a very old man and
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,3,a very old woman. They
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,4,lived in a nice clean
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,5,house which had flowers
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,6,"all around it, except where"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,7,the door was. But they couldn't
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,8,be happy because they were 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,9,so very lonely. 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,10,'If we only had a cat!' sighed the very
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,11,old woman.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,12,'A cat?' asked the very old man.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,13,"'Yes, a sweet little fluffy cat,' said"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,14,the very old woman.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,15,"'I will get you a cat, my dear,'"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,16,said the very old man.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,17,And he set out over the hills to look for
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,18,one. He climbed over the sunny hills. He
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,19,trudged through the cool valleys. He walked
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,20,"a long, long time and at last he came to a"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,21,hill which was a quite covered with cats.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,22,"Cats here, cats there,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,23,"Cats and kittens everywhere,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,24,"Hundreds of cats,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,25,"Thousands of cats,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,26,Millions and billions and trillions of cats.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,27,"'Oh,' cried the old man joyfully,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,28,'Now I can choose
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,29,the prettiest
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,30,cat and take
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,31,it home with 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,32,me!' So he
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,33,chose one.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,34,It was white.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,35,but just 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,36,as he was a-
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,37,"bout to leave,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,38,he saw anoth-
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,39,er one all
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,40,black and white
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,41,and it seemed
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,42,just as pretty as the first.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,43,So he took this one also. 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,44,But then he saw a fuzzy grey
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,45,kitten way over 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,46,here which was 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,47,every bit as
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,48,the others
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,49,so he took
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,50,it too. 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,51,And now
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,52,he saw one
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,53,way down
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,54,in a cor-
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,55,ner which
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,56,he thought 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,57,too lovely to 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,58,leave so he took this too.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,59,"And just then, over "
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,60,"here, the very old man"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,61,found a kitten which was 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,62,black and very beautiful.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,63,It would be a shame 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,64,"to leave that one,' said "
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,65,the very old man. So 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,66,he took it.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,67,"And now, even there, "
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,68,He saw a cat which had 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,69,brown and yellow stripes 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,70,like a baby tiger.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,71,'I simply must take
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,72,it!' cried the very old 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,73,"man, and he did."
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,74,So it happened that every 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,75,time the very old man looked 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,76,"up, he saw another cat "
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,77,which was so pretty he could not 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,78,"bear to leave it, and before he"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,79,"knew it, he had chosen them all."
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,80,And so he went back over the sunny hills and 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,81,"down through the cool valleys, to show all his"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,82,pretty kittens to the very old woman. 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,83,It was very funny to see those hundreds and 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,84,Thousands and millions and billions and trillions
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,85,of cats following him.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,86,They came to a pond.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,87,"'Mew, mew! We are thirsty!' cried the"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,88,"Hundreds of cats,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,89,"Thousands of cats,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,90,Millions and billions and trillions of cats.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,91,"'Well, here is a great deal of water,'"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,92,Said the very old man.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,93,"Each cat took a sip of water, and "
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,94,the pond was gone!
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,95,"'Mew, mew! Now we are hungry!' said the"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,96,"Hundreds of cats,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,97,"Thousands of cats,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,98,Millions and billions and trillions of cats
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,99,"'There is much grass on the hills,' said "
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,100,The very old man.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,101,Each cat ate a mouthful of grass and 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,102,not a blade was left!
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,103,Pretty soon the very old woman saw 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,104,them coming.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,105,"'My dear!' she cried, 'what are you"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,106,"doing? I asked for one little cat, and"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,107,what do I see? 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,108,"'Cats here, cats there,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,109,"Cats and kittens everywhere,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,110,"Hundreds of cats,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,111,"Thousands of cats,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,112,Millions and billions and trillions of cats.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,113,"'But we can never feed them all,' said the very"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,114,"old woman, 'they will eat us out of house and home.'"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,115,"'I never thought of that,' said the very old man, "
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,116,'What shall we do?'
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,117,The very old woman thought for a while and then 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,118,"She said, 'I know! We will let the cats decide "
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,119,which one we should keep.'
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,120,"'Oh yes,' said the very old man, and he called to "
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,121,"The cats, 'which one of you is the prettiest?'"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,122,'I am!'
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,123,'I am!'
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,124,"'No, I am!'"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,125,"'No, I am the prettiest!' 'I am!'"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,126,"'No, I am! I am! I am!' cried hundreds and thou-"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,127,sands and millions and billions and trillions of 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,128,"voices, for each cat thought itself the prettiest."
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,129,And they began to quarrel.   
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,130,They bit and scratched and clawed each
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,131,other and made such a great noise that the 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,132,very old mand and the very 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,133,old woman ran into the 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,134,house as fast as they 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,135,could. They did not 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,136,like such quarreling. 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,137,But after a while 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,138,the noise stopped
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,139,and the very old
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,140,man and the very 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,141,old woman peeped 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,142,out of the window 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,143,to see what had 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,144,happened. They 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,145,could not see a 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,146,single cat!
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,147,'I think
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,148,they must 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,149,have eaten 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,150,"each other all up,'"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,151,said they very old 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,152,"woman, 'It's too bad!'"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,153,'But look!' said the 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,154,"very old man, and he "
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,155,pointed to a bunch of 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,156,high grass. In it sat one 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,157,little frightened kitten.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,158,They went out and picked 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,159,it up. It was thin and scraggly.
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,160,"'Poor little kitty,' said the very old woman."
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,161,"'Dear little kitty,' said the very old man, 'how "
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,162,Does it happen that you were not eaten up with 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,163,all those hundred and thousands and millions 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,164,and billions and trillions of cats?'
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,165,"'Oh, I'm just a very homely little cat,' said the "
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,166,"kitten,' so when you asked who was the prettiest,"
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,167,I didn't say anything. So nobody bothered about me.'
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,168,"They took the kitten into the house, where the "
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,169,very old woman gave it a warm bath and brushed 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,170,its fur until is was soft and shiny. 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,171,Every day they gave 
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,172,it plenty of
L157,MILLIONS OF CATS,WANDA GAG,173,milk-

L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,1,Melvin did not deal well

L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,7,And if he didn't get exactly what he wanted...
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,8,"well, you know..."
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,9,"'Sorry, Melvin, they were out of dinosaur backpacks.'"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,10,"No, Melvin did NOT deal well"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,11,with disappointment.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,12,And this is why he HATED
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,13,his teacher's favorite rule.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,14,You get 
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,15,what you get
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,16,and you don't throw a FIT.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,17,"Because of this rule, Melvin could not throw a"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,18,fit if he had to use crayons instead of markers.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,19,He could not throw a fit if he ended up last in line.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,20,He couldn't even throw a fit if his napkin
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,21,was pink instead of green.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,22,"'Oh, well,' mumbled Melvin, 'at least I can still"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,23,throw a fit at home. My family doesn't know
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,24,a thing about that TERRIBLE rule.'
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,25,"But that night when it was Melvin's turn to choose the movie,"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,26,"things changed. As soon as he'd chosen Dinosaur Rumble, his"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,27,sister stomped her food and whined.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,28,'But I want to watch
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,29,A pony Called Trouble!'
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,30,"'TOO BAD! You get what you get,"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,31,"and you don't throw a fit,' said Melvin."
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,32,Everyone stopped and looked at Melvin.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,33,'What did you say?' asked Dad.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,34,"'You get what you get, and you"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,35,"don't throw a fit,' repeated Melvin."
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,36,"'So if your cookie only has a few chocolate chips,"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,37,you shouldn't throw a fit?' asked his sister.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,38,"'And if you lose a turn during a game,"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,39,you shouldn't throw a fit?' asked his dad.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,40,"'And if the dinosaur backpacks are all sold out,"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,41,"you should be happy with the robot one, and you"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,42,absolutely should not throw a fit?' asked his mom.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,43,Melvin gulped. There was no way to take it back.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,44,EVERYONE KNEW.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,45,"'Well, I mean, at school you shouldn't throw a fit,"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,46,"cause that's the rule. But at home, you can,' he said."
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,47,"'I think that sounds like a good rule for at home, too,' said Dad."
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,48,'I agree!' said Mom.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,49,"'Home and school, that's the rule!' his sister chanted."
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,50,Melvin wanted to CRY.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,51,He wanted to SHOUT.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,52,He wanted to lie down on the
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,53,ground and THROW
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,54,his arms and legs about.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,55,But he didn't.
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,56,"After all, you get what you get,"
L158,YOU GET WHAT YOU GET,JULIE GASSMAN,57,and you don't throw a fit.

L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),3,wasn't being blown by the wind. It was creeping down
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),4,the street on eight paws!
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),5,"Suddenly, a big gust blew the box away, revealing"
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),6,Skye and Rubble underneath. They quickly scampered
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),7,into the shop. 
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),8,"Inside, Ryder, Katie, and Rocky were getting"
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),9,ready for Chase's surprise birthday party.

L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),15,Pup Park. They swung on the swings and slid down

L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),58,to work on the broken windmill. Ryder climbed
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),59,Marshall's ladder and removed the old blade
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),60,while Rocky looked for a replacement piece.
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),61,"'No, not a tire... not a lawn chair,' Rocky"
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),62,"said, pulling stuff out of his truck. At last he found"

L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),66,the board into place. The wind picked up and the
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),67,windmill started to turn. Lights came on all over

L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),74,"'Hooray!' cheered Skye, but then she"
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),75,frowned. 'Aw! There's no time to make a cake.'
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),76,Katie thought for a moment. 'I have an idea!'
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),77,As Chase drove back to the

L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),84,chase stepped inside. The lights went on
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),85,'SURPRISE!' everyone yelled.
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),86,Chase was amazed. 'Wow! You guys turned
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),87,the lights back on AND made a party for me?'
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),88,"'We didn't have time to bake you a real cake,' Katie"
L161,PUPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU! (PAW PATROL),GOLDEN BOOKS (PUBLISHER),89,"said, 'so we hope you like your pup-treat cookie cake.'"

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,33,"Opening up a book, the bird began to"
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,34,read. She sang the story of an unlucky dog

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,36,A cool breeze carried his lively voice across

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,38,"But before long, he found himself"
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,39,captivated.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,40,To Rocket the story was as
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,41,delicious as the earthly smells of
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,42,fall. It was as exciting as chasing

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,44,'As Buster dog and dog under

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,46,'he felt something familiar.'
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,47,Rocket waited. 
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,48,Was it the bone? he wondered.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,49,Silence
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,50,'Was it the bone?' he called 
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,51,to the bird. 
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,52,More silence. 
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,53,'WAS IT THE BONE?!'
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,54,Rocket shouted.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,55,Suddenly he was

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,57,"'WELL,"
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,58,WAS IT?'
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,59,But the little yellow bird was gone.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,60,The next morning Rocket arrived early.

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,64,At last the little yellow bird appeared. 'Hello? How

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,67,"'I'd like to hear the end of the story, please,' said Rocket."
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,68,"'That seems like a fine way to start the day,' chirped the bird."
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,69,She gave Rocket a name tag and began to read.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,70,Every day Rocket
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,71,returned to the little yellow
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,72,bird's classroom.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,73,In the morning the bird
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,74,"Taught him a new letter,"
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,75,Until he had learnt all

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,77,gorgeous alphabet.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,78,Together they sound out the sounds that each

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,80,sounds they heard around them.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,81,With a G and many Rs they spelt
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,82,Mr. Barker's growl!
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,83,GRRRRRRRRR!
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,84,"Soon they spelled the sound of the wind, which was growing colder by the day."
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,85,WHHOOSSSHHHHHHHH....
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,86,Soon they were spelling words like F-A-L-L for the gusty
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,87,"Time of year, and R-E-D for the color of the leaves."
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,88,And each afternoon the bird read a story. She read stories
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,89,about dogs and birds. She read about leaves changing colors and
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,90,about birds flying south for the winter.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,91,"Then one day, the weather turned and"

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,93,"'See you again in the glorious spring,'"
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,94,the bird sang.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,95,"And as she flew into the wintry sky, she"

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,101,Soon Rocket's classroom
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,102,disappeared under the snow.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,103,He remembered the little
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,104,bird's alphabet and practiced his letters.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,105,[[ABC]]
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,106,He thought about the bird's sweet chirp while
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,107,he sounded out words.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,108,like D-I-G

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,110,and C-O-L-D.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,111,He made new friends and spelled their names.
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,112,"'Hi there, F-R-E-D.'"
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,113,"'Hello, E-M-M-A.'"

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,126,Soon the little yellow bird

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,134,Then together they began to read. They read stories about

L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,138,"And when they were finished, they read it again."
L167,HOW ROCKET LEARNED TO READ,TAD HILLS,139,And again.

L169,MAMA DON'T ALLOW,THACHER HURD,51,[[Make it sweet!]]

L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,1,Once there was a boy
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,2,and the boy loved stars very much.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,3,Every night the boy watched
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,4,the stars form his window
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,5,and wished he had one of his very own.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,6,He dreamed of how this star
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,7,would be his friend.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,8,They would play hide-and-go-seek
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,9,and take long walks together.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,10,The boy decided he would try to catch one.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,11,He thought that getting up early
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,12,"in the morning would be best,"
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,13,because then the star would be tired
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,14,from being up in the sky all night.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,15,The next day he set out at sunrise.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,16,But he could not see a star anywhere.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,17,So he sat down and waited for one to appear.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,18,He waited...
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,19,and he waited...
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,20,and ate lunch...
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,21,and waited...
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,22,And after dinner
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,23,he waited some more.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,24,"Finally, just before"
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,25,the sun was about
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,26,"to go away, he saw a star."
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,27,The boy tried
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,28,to jump up and grab it.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,29,But he could not
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,30,jump high enough.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,31,"So, very carefully,"
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,32,he climbed to the top
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,33,of the tallest
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,34,tree he could find.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,35,But the star was still way out of reach.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,36,He thought he might
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,37,lasso the star with
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,38,the life preserver
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,39,from his
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,40,father's
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,41,boat.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,42,But it was much too heavy
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,43,for him to carry.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,44,If only he could fly up in a spaceship and
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,45,just grab the star. But the only
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,46,"spaceship he owned was made of paper,"
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,47,and it didn't fly well at all.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,48,Perhaps he could get a seagull to help
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,49,him fly up into the sky to reach his star?
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,50,But the only seagull he could find
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,51,didn't want to help.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,52,The boy worried he would
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,53,never catch a star.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,54,Just hen he noticed something floating in the water.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,55,It was the prettiest star he had ever seen!
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,56,Just a baby star. It must have fallen from the sky.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,57,He tried to fish it out with his hands.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,58,But when the boy reached out to touch the
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,59,"star, it just rippled through his fingers."
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,60,"Now the boy was sad. But in his heart,"
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,61,the wish just wouldn't give up.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,62,"Slowly, he began walking home."
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,63,And that's when he saw it
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,64,washed up on the bright golden sand.
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,65,The boy had caught a star!
L170,HOW TO CATCH A STAR,OLIVER JEFFERS,66,A star of his very own.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,1,Once there was a boy
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,2,and one day he found a penguin at his door.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,3,The boy didn't know where it had come from
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,4,but it began to follow him everywhere.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,5,The penguin looked sad and
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,6,the boy thought it must lost.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,7,So the boy decided to help the penguin
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,8,find its way home.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,9,[[Lost and Found Here]]
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,10,He checked in the Lost and Found Office.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,11,But no one was missing a penguin.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,12,He asked some birds if they knew
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,13,where the penguin came from.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,14,But they ignored him.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,15,Some birds are like that.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,16,The boy asked his duck.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,17,But the duck floated away.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,18,He didn't know.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,19,"That night, the boy couldn't sleep for"
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,20,disappointment. He wanted to help the
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,21,penguin but he didn't know how.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,22,The next morning he discovered that
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,23,penguins come from the South Pole.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,24,But how could he get there?
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,25,He ran down to the harbor and asked a
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,26,big ship to take them to the South Pole.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,27,But his voice was much too small to
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,28,be heard over the ship's horn.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,29,"So together, he and the penguin would row"
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,30,to the South Pole. The boy took his rowboat
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,31,out of the cupboard and they tested it for
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,32,size and strength.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,33,They packed everything they would need...
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,34,and together they pushed
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,35,the rowboat out to sea.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,36,They rowed south for many days...
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,37,and nights with the boy telling stories all
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,38,the way. The penguin listened to everything
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,39,that the boy said.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,40,"They floated through good weather and bad,"
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,41,when the waves were as big as mountains...
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,42,until they came to the South Pole.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,43,[[South Pole]]
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,44,"The boy was delighted,"
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,45,but the penguin said nothing.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,46,Suddenly it looked sad again as
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,47,the boy helped it out of the boat.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,48,The boy said goodbye...
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,49,"and floated away. But as he looked back,"
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,50,the penguin looked sadder than ever.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,51,It felt strange to be on his own...
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,52,and the more he thought...
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,53,...the more he realized he was
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,54,making a big
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,55,mistake.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,56,The penguin wasn't lost. He was just lonely.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,57,Quickly he turned the boat around
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,58,and headed back to the South Pole
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,59,as fast as he could.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,60,[[South Pole]]
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,61,At last he reached
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,62,the Pole again.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,63,But where was
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,64,the penguin?
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,65,The boy searched
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,66,and searched but
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,67,he was nowhere
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,68,to be found.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,69,[[South Pole]]
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,70,Sadly the boy set off for home.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,71,There was no point telling stories
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,72,"because there was no one to listen,"
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,73,except the wind and the waves.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,74,but then the boy saw something
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,75,in the water ahead of him.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,76,"Closer and closer he got,"
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,77,until he could see...
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,78,...the penguin.
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,79,And so the boy and his friend went
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,80,"home together, talking of wonderful"
L171,LOST AND FOUND,OLIVER JEFFERS,81,things all the way.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,1,Morris Lessmore loved words.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,2,He loved stories. 
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,3,He loved books.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,4,"His life was a book of his own writing, one orderly page"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,5,after another. He would open it every morning and write
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,6,"of his joys and sorrows, of all that he knew"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,7,and everything that he hoped for.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,8,But every story had its upset.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,9,One day the sky darkened.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,10,The winds blew and blew...
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,11,till everything Morris knew was scattered  
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,12,even the words of his book
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,13,He didn't know what to do or which
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,14,"way to go. So he began to wander,"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,15,and wander.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,16,Then a happy bit of happenstance came his way.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,17,"Rather then looking down, as had become his habit."
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,18,Morris Lessmore looked up. Drifting though the sky
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,19,above him. Morris saw a lovely lady. She was being pulled
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,20,along by a festive squadron of flying books. 
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,21,Morris wondered if his books could fly. 
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,22,But it couldn't.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,23,It would only fall to the ground with a depressing thud.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,24,The flying lady knew Morris simply needed a good story.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,25,"So she sent him her favorite. The book was an amiable fellow,"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,26,And urged Morris to follow him. 
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,27,The book led him to an extraordinary building
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,28,where many books apparently 'nested.'
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,29,Morris slowly walked inside and discovered
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,30,the most mysterious and inviting room he had ever seen.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,31,"It was filled with the fluttering of countless pages,"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,32,and Morris could hear the fair chatter of a thousand
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,33,"different stories, as if each book was whispering"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,34,an invitation to adventure.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,35,Then his new friend flew up to him and landed on his
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,36,"arm. It held itself open, as if hoping to be read."
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,37,The room rustled to life.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,38,And so Morris's life among
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,39,the books began.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,40,Morris tried to keep the books in some sort of 
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,41,"order, but they always mixed themselves up."
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,42,The tragedies needed cheering up and would visit
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,43,"with the comedians. The encyclopedias, weary of facts,"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,44,would relax with the comic books and fictions.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,45,All in all it was an agreeable jumble.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,46,"Morris found great satisfaction in caring for the books,"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,47,"gently fixing them with fragile bindings,"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,48,and unfolding the dog-eared ages of others. 
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,49,Sometimes Morris would 
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,50,become lost in a book
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,51,and scarcely emerge
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,52,for days.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,53,Morris liked to share the books with others.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,54,"Sometimes it was a favorite that everyone loved,"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,55,and other times he found a lonely little volume
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,56,whose tale was seldom told.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,57,"'Everyone's story matters,' said Morris."
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,58,And all the books agreed.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,59,"At night, after all the stories that needed telling had been told"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,60,and everyone had settled down to their proper places on the 
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,61,"shelves, the great big dictionary would get in the last word:"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,62,[[zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz]]
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,63,It was then that Morris Lessmore would once again
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,64,write in his own book. He wrote of his joys and sorrows
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,65,of all that he knew and everything that he hoped for.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,66,The days passed.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,67,So did the months
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,68,And then years
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,69,And years ...
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,70,... and Morris Lessmore became
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,71,stopped and crinkly.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,72,But the books never changed.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,73,Their stories stayed the same.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,74,Now his old friends took care of him
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,75,the way he had once cared for them
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,76,and they read themselves to him
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,77,each night.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,78,Then one day he filled
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,79,the last page in his book.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,80,He looked up and said
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,81,"with a bittersweet sigh,"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,82,'I guess it's time
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,83,for me to move on.'
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,84,"The books were sorry, but they understood."
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,85,Morris put on his hat and took his cane.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,86,"As he went to the door, he turned and smiled and then"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,87,waved goodbye. 'I'll carry you all in here
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,88,"he said,  and pointed to his heart."
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,89,I'll carry you all in here.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,90,"The book waved their pages, and Morris Lessmore flew away."
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,91,"And as he flew, he changed back to the way he'd been"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,92,that long ago day when they'd all first met.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,93,The books were quiet for a while. Then they noticed
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,94,that Morris Lessmore had left something behind.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,95,"'It's his book,' said his oldest friend. Inside was Morris's story."
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,96,"All of his joys and sorrows,"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,97,all that he knew
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,98,and everything that he hoped for.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,99,"Then the books heard a small, expectant sound. There in"
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,100,the doorway was a little girl. She looked around with wonder.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,101,Then something fantastic happened.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,102,Morris Lessmore's book flew up to her and opened it's pages.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,103,The girl began to read.
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,104,And so our story ends as it began...
L172,THE FANTASTIC FLYING BOOKS OF MR. MORRIS LESSMORE,WILLIAM JOYCE,105,.. with the opening of a book.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,1,[[This toupÃ©e is killing me.]]
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,2,[[This skirt is from France.]]
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,3,"""Lulu, I want to go there."""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,4,My little brother Alexander whispered that to me while we were watching a funny opera called The Mikado.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,5,"""Where?"" I asked."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,6,"""To that place where they are singing. Pajan."""

L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,8,"""Yes, that's where I want to go. Now. Please."""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,9,"I had a piano lesson the next day with the dreaded Mrs. Kackleman, so it seemed like a great idea."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,10,"""Yes,"" I smiled, ""I will take you."""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,11,"I called the travel agent, Mr. Google."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,12,"""Hello, Mr. Google. Two seats on the Japan plane please. Thank you Mr. Google."""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,13,We kissed our parents good-bye. They said come back soon. Bring back presents.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,14,[[2 Noodles 2 Go]]
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,15,And off we went. Into the blue sky. To Japan.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,16,Which as I explained to the miniature midget (as I sometimes call my brother) is a skinny island next to China and the people are Japanese.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,17,"""Japansneeze!? They always sneeze?"""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,18,"""No,"" I yelled. ""Not sneeze, nese."""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,19,"""Knees? They walk on their knees?"" he screeched."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,20,"""No,"" I screamed. ""They are of Japan, Japanese."""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,21,"""Oh, I knew that,"" he said quietly."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,22,"We landed in a city called Tokyo. The people are very polite and are always saying, ""Domo arigato gozaimasu,"" which means, ""Thank you very very much."""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,23,The alphabet looks like little stick pictures. We looked at a sign.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,24,Alexander thought it meant
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,25,DON'T JUMP ON THE BED
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,26,but I knew it meant
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,27,TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,28,"We hopped into a red taxi with a driver in white gloves and sharp black hair. Everyone in Japan has black hair. Not red, not yellow, not green, just black."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,29,"Narrow streets whizzed by. Little houses and stores. People on bicycles, people walking."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,30,"Our hotel was a ryokan, which is like a Japanese home. You take your shoes off before you step inside, so you must make sure that your socks don't have holes. You walk on mats called tatami. And you sleep on the floor on a cushy pad called a futon and cover yourself with a quilt as soft as a cloud. We sat on the floor at a table and had jasmine tea and rice crackers."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,31,Outside our window we heard music. Under fluttering cherry blossoms women danced to the playing of flutes.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,32,"The door knocked. In walked our guide, Hiroko. She was going to show us many places."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,33,Alexander made up a poem that I was very proud of.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,34,"Hey Hiroko, are you loco? Would you like a cup of cocoa?"
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,35,We opened the present that Hiroko brought - a book with pictures of schoolchildren many years ago. They were dressed in beautiful robes called kimonos. Now children wear school uniforms and the girls have braids that point to the ground. We wanted to meet the children at school. We jumped up.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,36,"""I will take you,"" said Hiroko. We went to the subway."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,37,"The subway was shining and quiet. The workers stood in crisp uniforms. The train smoothed into the station and was full of people. We were like marshmallows all stuffed together in a bag bouncing along, but nobody stuck their elbow in my ear."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,38,"In the school, the children bowed hello, singing a good morning song. Other children were reading a story about a man who traveled to a magic castle under the sea on the back of a turtle. Other children were learning music and the birds chirped on trees."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,39,"Walking in the sun, we passed a man sitting on a bench. His black, crooked cane poked the ground and looked like a snake."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,40,"We went to a noodle restaurant. Alexander said they served oodles and poodles of noodles. The waiter brought us little hot wet white towels. We wiped our hands. The bowls of noodles arrived with chopsticks. Alexander's chopsticks kept flipping and flying through the air. I taught him how to use them and we all slurped our noodles, which is a perfectly fine thing to do in Japan."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,41,"Strolling along, we came to a rock garden. There were big rocks that were like islands. All around them, sand was raked into patterns like the ocean. And even if one tiny leaf fell on the sand, a gardener would come and pluck it away using a long pole with a pin on the end. In the pond, big spotted carp wiggled to our feet. The quiet was so quiet that the quiet filled the air."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,42,"Suddenly, a frog spoke to us. ""Excuse me, would you like to hear my haiku?"""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,43,A frog is no frog
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,44,if he is a prince which I
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,45,am certainly not
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,46,We went to eat. At the restaurant we took off our shoes. Alexander was sure they were cooking our shoes.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,47,Shoe soup?
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,48,Shoe sandwiches?
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,49,Shoe pie?
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,50,But really it was rice and vegetables tied with tiny seaweed bows.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,51,"It was a dreamy night. We wandered through the city and went to a movie called Godzilla. This giant lizard clomped around Tokyo scaring everyone and Alexander said, ""That Godzilla is my friend."""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,52,The next morning Hiroko came to our door.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,53,"""This is a fishy morning,"" she announced. ""I would like to take you to the fish market."""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,54,"There are little places to eat raw fish called sushi, which frog boy (as I sometimes call my slippery brother) calls squishy."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,55,We walked to an old temple where people tied zillions of little pieces of paper with wishes on them to a tree. People pulled long heavy ropes that made big bells ring. And the sound of the ringing would ring up to the sky. Alexander wished for a flying bike and I wished for a dancing dog.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,56,"""And now,"" said Hiroko, ""we will take a bath."""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,57,"""Now? Here?"""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,58,"""No, up there."""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,59,She pointed to a mountain. We got on a little wooden train.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,60,"In the middle of a pine forest was the bath. Alexander wanted to jump right in, but there are things you must do first. Like take off all your clothes. We sat on benches, scrubbed like crazy and rinsed with buckets of water. Then we scrubbed some more and rinsed some more. Then we stepped into the steamy water, sat down, closed our eyes and the smell of pines filled our noses and made us smile."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,61,"Extremely clean, we went to a fancy cafÃ©. Alexander wrote poems. I blinked at the chandeliers. Our waiter curved over us with small sweet mountains of green ice."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,62,"Hiroko said, ""I want to take you to a play called Noh."""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,63,"""Yes?"" asked Alexander."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,64,"""No, not yes, Noh,"" I said."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,65,"""Oh no?"""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,66,"""No, not no, Noh."""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,67,"""Oh, Noh,"" smiled Alexander understanding."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,68,"""Well let's go!"""
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,69,There were dragons and people in masks and nobody moved for one hour including Alexander who fell asleep.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,70,"The next morning the door knocked and in walked Hiroko. She said, ""Today I would like to take you on a very fast train. So fast it is called the Bullet Train."" The train was so fast we were back before we left. That's fast."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,71,"Hiroko's best friend, a beautiful movie star named Fujiko gave us a good-bye party. Paper lanterns swung in the breeze. The evening was warm. Alexander, my little brother spoke his farewell poem."
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,72,"Oh, Japan kids"
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,73,you eat raw fish
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,74,a crazy dish
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,75,the way you bow
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,76,is really wow
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,77,Hai is yes
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,78,and Noh is a show
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,79,I've got to iku
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,80,which means go.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,81,Sayonara and good-bye
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,82,please don't cry
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,83,you might swallow
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,84,a fly.
L173,"SAYONARA, MRS. KACKLEMAN",MAIRA KALMAN,85,"Full of presents we flew, into the arms of our parents. We were back. Back to the twins SalomÃ© and Mona. Back to the little green man who floats on the ceiling, and back to our good friend Bruno and his invisible paintings. But that is another story."

L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,1,"Oh, how Peter wished he could whistle!"
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,2,He saw a boy playing with his dog. Whenever
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,3,"the boy whistled, the dog ran straight to him. "
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,4,"Peter tried and tried to whistle, but he "
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,5,couldn't. So instead he began to turn 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,6,himself around-
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,7,around and around he whirled.....
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,8,faster and faster.... 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,9,When he stopped 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,10,everything turned 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,11,down...... 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,12,and up....... 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,13,And up...... 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,14,and down 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,15,and around
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,16,and around.
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,17,"Peter saw his dog, Willie, coming."
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,18,"Quick as a wink, he hid in an empty"
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,19,carton lying on the sidewalk.
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,20,'Wouldn't it be funny if I whistled?' Peter
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,21,thought. 'Willie would stop and look all 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,22,around to see who it was.' 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,23,Peter tried again to whistle---but still he 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,24,couldn't. So Willie just walked on. 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,25,Peter got out of the carton and started home. 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,26,On the way he took some colored chalks out 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,27,"of his pocket and drew a long, long line. "
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,28,right up to his door.
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,29,He stood there and tried to whistle
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,30,again. He blew till his cheeks were 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,31,tired. But nothing happened. 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,32,He went into his house and put on his 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,33,father's old hat to make himself feel more 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,34,grown-up. He looked into the mirror to 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,35,practice whistling. Still no whistle! 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,36,"When his mother saw what he was doing,"
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,37,Peter pretended that he was his father.
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,38,"He said, 'I've come home early today, dear."
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,39,Is Pete here?'
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,40,"His mother answered, 'Why no, he's outside "
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,41,with Willie.'
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,42,"'Well, I'll go out and look for them,' said Peter."
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,43,First he walked a long a crack in the 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,44,sidewalk. Then he tried to run away
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,45,from his shadow. 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,46,He jumped off his shadow. 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,47,But when he landed 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,48,they were 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,49,together 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,50,again. 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,51,He came to the corner 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,52,"where the carton was, "
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,53,and who should he see 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,54,but Willie! 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,55,Peter scrambled under the carton. 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,56,He blew and blew. 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,57,Suddenly ---- out came a real whistle! 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,58,Willie stopped and looked around to 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,59,see who it was. 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,60,"'It's me,' Peter shouted, and stood up. "
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,61,Willie raced straight to him. 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,62,Peter ran home to show his father and 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,63,mother what he could do.
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,64,They loved Peter's whistling. So did Wille.
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,65,Peter's mother asked him and Willie 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,66,to go on an errand to the grocery store. 
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,67,"He whistle all the way there, "
L175,WHISTLE FOR WILLIE,EZRA JACK KEATS,68,and he whistle all the way home.

L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,1,Today Elmo and his mommy are babysitting for
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,2,"Elmo's little cousins, Albie and Baby Jo-Jo."
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,3,Elmo and Albie are busy playing. Jo-Jo is fussing.
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,4,"'It might be time for a diaper change, little Jo-Jo,'"
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,5,says Elmo's mommy.
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,6,"I used to wear diapers like Jo-Jo,' Albie "
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,7,says proudly. 'But now I'm learning to use
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,8,"the potty just like you, Elmo!'"
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,9,"'Oh, yes! You do need a change,' says Elmo's"
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,10,mommy. 'Your diaper is wet!' Jo-Jo smiles and coos
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,11,as Elmo's mommy changes his diaper.
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,12,'I don't have to wear diapers anymore!' Albie
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,13,says again.
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,14,'Hooray for Albie!' Elmo cheers.
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,15,"'That's right, Albie,' Elmo's mommy says. 'You're"
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,16,wearing pull-ups now and learning to be a big boy.'
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,17,"After lunch, Elmo says, 'Now Elmo needs"
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,18,to use the potty.'
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,19,"When he's done, he uses toilet paper to"
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,20,dry himself-but just a little bit.
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,21,Then he flushes the toilet
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,22,and pulls up his big-boy

L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,27,'Does Albie need to use the potty now?' asks Elmo.
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,28,Albie shakes his head. 'I don't think so.'
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,29,"Later, Elmo and Albie dig and build and dig some more."
L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,30,"'C'mon, Albie. Let's make a castle for knights and"

L178,P IS FOR POTTY!,NAOMI KLEINBERG,32,"Suddenly Albie says, 'Uh-oh. I forgot to go potty.'"

L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,1,"One day, a lion came into the library."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,2,He walked right past the circulation desk 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,3,and up into the stacks.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,4,Mr. McBee ran down the hall to the head
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,5,librarian's office. 'Miss Merriweather!'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,6,he called.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,7,"'No running,' said Miss Merriweather,"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,8,without looking up.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,9,'But there's a lion!' said Mr. McBee.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,10,'In the library!'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,11,'Is he breaking any rules?' asked Miss
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,12,Merriweather. She was very particular 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,13,about rule breaking.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,14,"'Well, no,' said Mr. McBee. 'Not really.'"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,15,'Then leave him be.'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,16,The lion wandered all around the library. He sniffed
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,17,the card catalog.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,18,He rubbed his head against the new book collection
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,19,Then he padded over to the story corner and went 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,20,to sleep.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,21,No one was sure what to do. There weren't any rules 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,22,about lions in the library.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,23,Soon it was time for story hour. There weren't any
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,24,"rules about lions at story hour, either."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,25,The story lady seemed a little nervous. But she read 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,26,"out the first book's title in a good, clear voice. The lion "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,27,looked up. The story lady kept reading. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,28,The lion stayed for the next story. And the story after 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,29,"that. He waited for another story, but the children "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,30,began to walk away.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,31,"'Story hour is over,' a little girl told him. 'It's time "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,32,to go.'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,33,The lion looked at the children. He looked at the 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,34,story lady. He looked at the closed books. Then he 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,35,roared very loud.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,36,[[RAAAHHRRRR!]]
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,37,Miss Merriweather came striding out of 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,38,her office. 'Who is making that noise?'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,39,she demanded.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,40,"'It's the lion,' said Mr. McBee."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,41,Miss Werriweather marched over to the lion.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,42,"'If you cannot be quiet, you will have "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,43,"to leave,' she said in a stern voice. 'Those"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,44,are the rules!'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,45,The lion kept roaring. He sounded sad.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,46,The little girl tugged on Miss Merriweather's
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,47,"dress. 'If he promises to be quiet, can he come"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,48,back for story hour tomorrow?' she asked.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,49,The lion stopped roaring. He looked at
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,50,Miss Merriweather.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,51,Miss Merriweather looked back. Then she
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,52,"said, 'Yes. A nice, quiet lion would certainly "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,53,be allowed to come back for story hour tomorrow.'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,54,'Hooray!' said the children. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,55,"The next day, the lion came back."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,56,"'You are early,' said Miss Merriweather."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,57,'Story hour is not until three o-clock.'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,58,The lion did not budge.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,59,"'Very well,' said Miss Merriweather."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,60,'You might as well make yourself 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,61,useful.' She sent him off 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,62,to dust encyclopedias 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,63,until it was time for 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,64,story hour. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,65,"The next day, the lion came early again. This time,"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,66,Miss Merriweather asked him to lick all the envelopes
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,67,for the overdue notices. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,68,Soon the lion began doing things without 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,69,being asked. He dusted the encyclopedias. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,70,He licked the envelopes. He let small children 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,71,stand on his back to reach books on the highest shelves.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,72,Then he curled up in the story corner to 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,73,wait for story hour to begin. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,74,"At first, the people in the library were "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,75,nervous about the lion. But soon they got 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,76,"used to having him around. In fact, he "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,77,seemed very well suited for the library. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,78,His big feel were quiet on the library floor.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,79,He made a comfy backrest for the children 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,80,at story hour. And he never roared in the 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,81,library anymore.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,82,"'What a helpful lion,' people said."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,83,They patted his soft head as he walked by.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,84,'How did we ever get along without him?'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,85,Mr. McBee scowled when he heard that.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,86,They had always gotten along fine before. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,87,"No lions were needed! Lions, he thought, "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,88,could not understand rules. They did not 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,89,belong in the library. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,90,"One day, after he had dusted all the "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,91,encyclopedias and licked all the 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,92,"envelopes and helped all the small children, "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,93,the lion padded down the hall to Miss
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,94,Merriweather's office to see what else there
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,95,was to do. There was still some time left 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,96,before story hour.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,97,"'Hello, Lion,' said Miss Merriweather."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,98,'I know something you can do. You can 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,99,bring a book back into the stacks for me. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,100,Let me just get down from the shelf.'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,101,Miss Merriweather stepped up onto the
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,102,step stool. The book was just out of reach.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,103,Miss Merriweather stood on her toes. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,104,She stretched out her finger.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,105,'Almost...there...' she said.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,106,Then Miss Merriweather stretched a 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,107,little too far.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,108,"'Ouch,' said Miss Merriweather softly."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,109,She did not get up.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,110,'Mr. McBee!' she called after a minute.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,111,'Mr. McBee!'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,112,But Mr. McBee was at the circulation 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,113,desk. He could not hear her calling.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,114,"'Lion,' said Miss Merriweather. 'Please"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,115,go and get Mr. McBee.'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,116,The lion ran down the hall.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,117,"'No running,' Miss Merriweather called "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,118,after him.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,119,The lion put his big front paws up on the big 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,120,circulation desk and looked at Mr. McBee.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,121,"'Go away, Lion,' said Mr. McBee."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,122,'I'm busy.'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,123,The lion whined. He pointed his nose down 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,124,the hall toward Miss. Merriweather's office.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,125,Mr. McBee ignored him.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,126,"Finally, the lion did the only thing he"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,127,could think of to do. He looked Mr. McBee
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,128,right in the eye. Then he opened his mouth 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,129,very wide. And he roared the loudest roar
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,130,he had ever roared in his life.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,131,[[RAAAHHHRRR!]]
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,132,Mr. McBee gasped.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,133,'You're not being quiet!' he said to 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,134,the lion. 'You're breaking the rules!'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,135,Mr. McBee walked down the hall as
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,136,fast as he could.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,137,The lion did not follow him. He had
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,138,broken the rules. He knew what that 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,139,meant. He hung his head and walked 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,140,toward the doors. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,141,Mr. McBee did not notice. 'Miss 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,142,Merriweather!' he called as he walked. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,143,'Miss Merriweather! The lion broke 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,144,the rules! The lion broke the rules!'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,145,He burst into Miss Merriweather's office.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,146,She was not in her chair.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,147,'Miss Merriweather?' he asked.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,148,"'Sometimes,' said Miss Merriweather from "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,149,"the floor behind her desk, 'there is "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,150,a good reason to break the rules. Even in 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,151,the library. Now please go call a doctor.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,152,I think I've broken my arm.'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,153,Mr. McBee ran to call a doctor.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,154,'No running!' Miss Merriweather called
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,155,after him. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,156,"The next day, things were back to normal."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,157,Almost.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,158,Miss Merriweather's left arm was in a 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,159,cast. The doctor had told her not to work 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,160,too hard.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,161,"'I will have my lion to help me,' Miss "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,162,Merriweather thought. But the lion did not 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,163,come to the library that morning.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,164,"At three o'clock, Miss Merriweather "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,165,Walked over to the story corner. The story 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,166,Lady was just beginning a story for the 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,167,children. The lion was not there. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,168,People in the library kept looking up 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,169,"from their books and computer screens,"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,170,hoping they would see a familiar furry 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,171,face. But the lion did not come that day.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,172,"The lion did not come the next day, "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,173,either. Or the next day after that.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,174,"One evening, Mr. McBee stopped by"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,175, Miss Merriweather's office on his way 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,176,"out. 'Can I do anything for you before I go,"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,177,Miss Merriweather?' he asked her.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,178,"'No, thank you,' said Miss Merriweather."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,179,She was looking out the window. Her voice 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,180,was very quiet. Even for the library.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,181,Mr. McBee frowned as he walked away.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,182,He thought there probably was something
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,183,"he could do for Miss Merriweather, after all. "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,184,Mr. McBee left the library. But he did not go home.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,185,He walked around the neighborhood.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,186,He looked under cars. He looked behind bushes. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,187,He looked in backyards and trash cans and tree houses. 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,188,Finally he circled all the way back to 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,189,the library.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,190,"The lion was sitting outside, looking in "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,191,through the glass doors.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,192,"'Hello, Lion,' said Mr. McBee."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,193,The lion did not turn around.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,194,"'I thought you might like to know,'"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,195,"said Mr. McBee, 'that there's a new rule "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,196,"at the library. No roaring allowed, unless "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,197,"you have a very good reason-say, if"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,198,you're trying to help a friend who's been 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,199,"hurt, for example.'"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,200,The lion's ears twitched. He turned around.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,201,But Mr. McBee was already walking away.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,202,"The next day, Mr. McBee walked down"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,203,the hall to Miss Merriweather's office.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,204,"'What is it, Mr. McBee?' asked Miss"
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,205,"Merriweather in her new, sad, quiet voice."
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,206,"'I thought you might like to know,' said "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,207,"Mr. McBee, 'that there's a lion. In the "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,208,library.'
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,209,Miss Merriweather jumped up from her 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,210,chair and ran down the hall.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,211,"Mr. McBee smiled, 'No running!' he called "
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,212,after her.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,213,Miss Merriweather didn't listen.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,214,Sometimes there was 
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,215,a good reason to break the rules.
L179,LIBRARY LION,MICHELLE KNUDSEN,216,Even in the library.

L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,1, 
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,2,Once upon a time in Paris there
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,3,lived a little boy whose name
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,4,was Pascal. He had no brothers
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,5,"or sisters, and he was very sad"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,6,and lonely at home.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,7,Once he brought home a lost
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,8,"cat, and some time later a stray"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,9,puppy. But his mother said
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,10,animals brought dirt into the
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,11,"house, and so Pascal was soon"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,12,alone again in his mother's
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,13,clean well-kept rooms.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,14,"Then one day, on his way to"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,15,"school, he caught sight of a fine"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,16,"red balloon, tied to a street lamp."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,17,Pascal laid his school bag on
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,18,the ground. He climbed up the
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,19,"lamppost, untied the balloon,"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,20,and ran off with it to the bus stop.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,21,"But the conductor knew the rules. ""No dogs,"" he said. ""No large packages,"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,22,"no balloons."""
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,23,People with dogs walk.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,24,People with packages take taxis.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,25,People with balloons leave them behind.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,26,"Pascal did not want to leave his balloon behind, so the conductor rang the"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,27,signal bell and the bus went on without him.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,28,"Pascal's school was a long way off, and when he finally reached the school"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,29,door it was already shut. To be late for school and with a balloon - that was
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,30,unheard of! Pascal was very worried.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,31,"Then he had an idea. He left his balloon with the janitor, who was sweeping"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,32,"the yard. And since it was the first time that he had ever been late, he was"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,33,not punished.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,34,"When school was over, the janitor, who had kept the balloon in his room for"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,35,"Pascal, gave it back to him."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,36,But it had begun to rain. And Pascal had to walk home because of those silly
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,37,rules about balloons on buses. But he thought his balloon shouldn't get wet.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,38,"There was an old gentleman just going by, and Pascal asked him whether he"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,39,"and the balloon could take shelter under his umbrella. So, from one umbrella"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,40,"to another, Pascal made his way home."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,41,His mother was glad to see him finally come home. But since she had been
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,42,"very worried, she was angry when she found out that it was a balloon that had"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,43,"made Pascal late. She took the balloon, opened the window, and threw it out."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,44,"Now, usually when you let a balloon go, it flies away. But Pascal's balloon"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,45,"stayed outside the window, and the two of them looked at each other through"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,46,"the glass. Pascal was surprised that his balloon hadn't flown away, but not"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,47,really as surprised as all that. Friends will do all kinds of things for you. If the
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,48,"friend happens to be a balloon, it doesn't fly away. So Pascal opened his"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,49,"window quietly, took his balloon back inside, and hid it in his room."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,50,"The next day, before he left for school, Pascal opened the window to let his"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,51,balloon out and told it to come to him when he called.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,52,"Then he picked up his school bag, kissed his mother good-by, and went"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,53,downstairs.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,54,"When he reached the street he called: ""Balloon! Balloon!"" and the balloon"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,55,came flying down to him.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,56,"Then it began to follow Pascal - without being led by a string, just as if it were a dog following its master."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,57,"But, like a dog, it didn't always"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,58,do as it was told. When Pascal
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,59,Tried to catch it to cross the
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,60,"Street, the balloon flew beyond"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,61,His reach.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,62,Pascal decided to pretend he
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,63,didn't care. He walked up the
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,64,street just as if the balloon
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,65,weren't there at all and hid be-
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,66,hind the corner of a house. The
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,67,balloon got worried and hurried
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,68,to catch up with him.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,69,"When they got to the bus stop,"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,70,"Pascal said to the balloon: ""Now,"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,71,"balloon, you follow me. Don't lose"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,72,"sight of the bus!"""
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,73,That was how the strangest sight
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,74,came to be seen in a Paris street-
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,75,a balloon flying along behind
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,76,a bus.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,77,"When they reached Pascal's school, the balloon again tried not to let itself be"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,78,"caught. But the bell was already ringing and the door was just about to close,"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,79,so Pascal had to hurry in alone. He was very worried.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,80,But the balloon flew over the school wall and got in line behind the children.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,81,"The teacher was very surprised to see this strange new pupil, and when the"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,82,"balloon tried to follow them into the classroom, the children made so much"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,83,noise that the principal came along to see what was happening.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,84,The principal tried to catch the balloon to put it out the door. But he couldn't.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,85,So he took Pascal by the hand and marched him out of school. The balloon left
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,86,the classroom and followed them.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,87,"The principal had urgent business at the Town Hall, and he didn't know what to"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,88,do with Pascal and his balloon. So he locked the boy up inside his office. The
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,89,"balloon, he said to himself, would stay outside the door."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,90,But that wasn't the balloon's idea at all. When it saw that the principal had put
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,91,"the key in his pocket, it sailed along behind him as he walked down the street."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,92,"All the people knew the principal very well, and when they saw him walking"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,93,"past followed by a balloon they shook their heads and said: ""The principal's"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,94,"playing a joke. It isn't right; a principal should be dignified, he shouldn't be"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,95,"playing like one of the boys in his school."""
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,96,"The poor man tried very hard to catch the balloon, but he couldn't, so there was"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,97,nothing for him to do but put up with it. Outside the Town Hall the balloon
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,98,"stopped. It waited for him in the street, and when the principal went back to"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,99,school the balloon was still behind him.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,100,"The principal was only too glad to let Pascal out of his office, and to be rid of"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,101,him and his balloon.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,102,On the way home Pascal stopped to look at a picture in a sidewalk exhibit. It
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,103,showed a little girl with a hoop. Pascal thought how nice it would be to have a
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,104,friend like that little girl.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,105,"But just at that moment he met a real little girl, looking just like the one in the"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,106,"picture. She was wearing a pretty white dress, and she held in her hand the"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,107,string... to a blue balloon!
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,108,Pascal wanted to be sure she noticed that his balloon was a magic one. But
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,109,"his balloon wouldn't be caught, and the little girl began to laugh."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,110,"Pascal was angry. ""What's the use of having a trained balloon if it won't do"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,111,"what you want?"" He said to himself. At that very moment some of the tough"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,112,boys of the neighborhood came by. They tried to catch the balloon as it trailed
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,113,Along behind Pascal. But the balloon saw the danger. It flew to Pascal at once.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,114,"He caught it and began to run, but more boys came to corner him from the"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,115,other side.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,116,"So Pascal let go of his balloon, which immediately rose high into the sky."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,117,"While the boys were all looking up, Pascal ran between them to the top of the"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,118,"steps. From there he called his balloon, which came to him at once- to the great"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,119,surprise of the boys in the gang.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,120,So Pascal and his balloon got home without being caught.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,121,"The next day was Sunday. Before he left for church, Pascal told his balloon to"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,122,"stay quietly at home, not to break anything, and especially not go out."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,123,But the balloon did exactly as it pleased. Pascal and his mother were hardly
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,124,seated in church when the balloon appeared and hung quietly in the air
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,125,behind them.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,126,"Now, a church is no place for a balloon. Everyone was looking at it and no one"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,127,"was paying attention to the service. Pascal had to leave in a hurry, followed"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,128,out by the church guard. His balloon certainly had no sense of what was proper.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,129,Pascal had plenty of worries!
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,130,All this worry had made him hungry. And as he still had his coin for the collec-
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,131,"tion plate, he went into a bakeshop for some cake. Before he went inside he"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,132,"said to the balloon: ""Now be good and wait for me. Don't go away."""
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,133,"The balloon was good, and only went as far as the corner of the shop to warm"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,134,itself in the sun. But that was already too far. For the gang of boys who had
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,135,"tried to catch it the day before saw it, and they thought that was the"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,136,"moment to try again. Without being seen they crept up to it, jumped on it and"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,137,carried it away.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,138,"When Pascal came out of the bakeshop, there was no balloon! He ran in every"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,139,"direction, looking up at the sky. The balloon had disobeyed him again! It had"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,140,"gone off by itself! And although he called at the top of his voice, the balloon"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,141,did not come back.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,142,"The gang had tied the balloon to a strong string, and they were trying to teach"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,143,"it tricks. ""We could show this magic balloon in a circus,"" one of them said. He"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,144,"shook a stick at the balloon. ""Come here or I'll burst you,"" he shouted."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,145,"As luck would have it, Pascal saw the balloon over the top of a wall, desper-"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,146,ately dragging at the end of its heavy string. He called to it.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,147,"As soon as it heard his voice, the balloon flew toward him. Pascal quickly"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,148,untied the string and ran off with his balloon as fast as he could run.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,149,The boys raced after them. They made so much noise that everyone in the
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,150,neighborhood stopped to watch the chase. It seemed as if Pascal had stolen
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,151,"the boys' balloon. Pascal thought: ""I'll hide in the crowd."" But a red balloon can"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,152,"be seen anywhere, even in a crowd."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,153,"Pascal ran through narrow alleys, trying to lose the gang of boys."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,154,"At one point the boys didn't know whether Pascal had turned right or left, so"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,155,they split up into several groups. For a minute Pascal thought he had escaped
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,156,"them, and he looked around for a place to rest. But as he rounded a corner he"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,157,"bumped right into one of the gang. He ran back the way he had come, but"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,158,there were more boys there. He was desperate - he ran up a side street which
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,159,led to an empty lot. He thought he'd be safe there.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,160,"But suddenly boys appeared from every direction, and Pascal was surrounded."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,161,"So he let go of his balloon. But this time, instead of chasing the balloon, the gang"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,162,"attacked Pascal. The balloon flew a little way off, but when it saw Pascal fight-"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,163,ing it came back. The boys began throwing stones at the balloon.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,164,"""Fly away, balloon! Fly away!"" Pascal cried. But the balloon would not leave"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,165,its friend.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,166,"Then one of the stones hit the balloon, and it burst."
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,167,"While Pascal was crying over his dead balloon, the strangest thing happened!"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,168,Everywhere balloons could be seen flying up into the air and forming a line
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,169,high into the sky.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,170,It was the revolt of all captive balloons!
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,171,"And all the balloons of Paris came down to Pascal, dancing around him,"
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,172,twisting their strings into one strong one and lifting him up into the sky.
L181,THE RED BALLOON,ALBERT LAMORISSE,173,And that was how Pascal took a wonderful trip all around the world.

L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,1,Spring
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,2,Frog ran up the path
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,3,to Toad's house.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,4,He knocked on the front door.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,5,There was no answer.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,6,"'Toad, Toad,' shouted Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,7,'wake up. It is spring!'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,8,"'Blah,' said a voice"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,9,from inside the house.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,10,'Toad! Toad!' cried Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,11,'The sun is shining!
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,12,The snow is melting. Wake up!'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,13,"'I am not here,' said the voice."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,14,Frog walked into the house.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,15,It was dark.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,16,All the shutters were closed.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,17,"'Toad, where are you!' called Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,18,"'Go away,' said the voice"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,19,from the corner of the room.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,20,Toad was lying in bed.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,21,He had pulled all the covers
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,22,over his head.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,23,Frog pushed Toad out of bed.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,24,He pushed him out of the house
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,25,and onto the front porch.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,26,Toad blinked in the bright sun.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,27,"'Help,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,28,'I cannot see anything.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,29,"'Don't be silly,' said Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,30,'What you see
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,31,is the clear warm light of April.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,32,And it means 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,33,that we can begin
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,34,"a whole new year together, Toad. "
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,35,"Think of it,' said Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,36,'We will skip through the meadow
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,37,and run through the woods
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,38,and swim in the river. 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,39,In the evenings we will sit 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,40,right here on this front porch
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,41,and count the stars.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,42,"'You can count them, Frog,'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,43,said Toad. 'I will be too tired.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,44,I am going back to bed.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,45,Toad went back into the house.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,46,He got into the bed
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,47,and pulled the covers 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,48,over his head again. 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,49,"'But, Toad,' cried Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,50,'you will miss all the fun!'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,51,"'Listen, Frog,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,52,'How long have I been asleep?'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,53,'You have been asleep
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,54,"since November,' said Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,55,"'Well then,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,56,'a little more sleep
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,57,will not hurt me.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,58,Come back again and wake me up
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,59,at about half past May.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,60,"Good night, Frog.'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,61,"'But, Toad,' said Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,62,'I will be lonely until then.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,63,Toad did not answer.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,64,He had fallen asleep.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,65,Frog looked at Toad's calendar.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,66,The November page was still on top.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,67,Frog tore off the November page.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,68,He tore off the December page.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,69,And the January page
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,70,the February page
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,71,and the March page.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,72,He came to the April page.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,73,Frog tore off the April page too. 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,74,Then Frog ran back to Toad's bed.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,75,"'Toad, Toad, wake up. It is May now.'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,76,'What?' said Toad.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,77,'Can it be May so soon?'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,78,"'Yes,' said Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,79,'Look at your calendar.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,80,Toad looked at the calendar.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,81,The may page was on top.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,82,"'Why, it is May!' said Toad"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,83,as he climbed out of the bed.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,84,Then he and Frog
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,85,ran outside
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,86,to see how the world
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,87,was looking in the spring. 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,88,The Story
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,89,One day in summer
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,90,Frog was not feeling well. 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,91,"Toad said, 'Frog,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,92,"you are looking quite green,'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,93,"'But I always look gree,'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,94,said Frog. 'I am a frog.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,95,'Today you look very green
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,96,"even for a frog,' said Toad. "
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,97,'get into my bed and rest.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,98,Toad made Frog a cup of hot tea.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,99,"Frog drank the tea, and then he said,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,100,'Tell me a story while I am resting.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,101,"'All right,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,102,'Let me think of a story to tell you.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,103,Toad thought and thought.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,104,But he could not think of a story
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,105,to tell Frog. 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,106,'I will go out on the front porch
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,107,"and walk up and down,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,108,'perhaps that will help me
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,109,to think of a story.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,110,Toad walked up and down
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,111,on the porch for the long time. 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,112,But he could not think of a story 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,113,to tell Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,114,Then Toad went into the house
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,115,and stood on this head. 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,116,'Why are you standing
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,117,on your head?' asked Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,118,"'I hope that if I stand on my head,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,119,it will help me
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,120,"to think of a story,' said Toad. "
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,121,Toad stood on his head
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,122,for a long time.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,123,But he could not think
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,124,of a story to tell Frog. 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,125,Then Toad poured a glass of water
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,126,over his head.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,127,'Why are you pouring water
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,128,over your head?' asked Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,129,'I hope that if I pour water
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,130,"over my head,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,131,it will help me to think
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,132,"of a story,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,133,Toad poured many glasses of water
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,134,over his head.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,135,But he could not think
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,136,of a story to tell Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,137,Then Toad began
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,138,to bang his head against the wall.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,139,'Why are you hanging your head
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,140,against the wall?' asked Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,141,'I hope that if I bang my head 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,142,"against the wall hard enough,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,143,"it will help me to think of a story,'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,144,said Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,145,"'I am feeling much better now, Toad,'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,146,said Frog. 'I do not think
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,147,I need a story anymore.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,148,'Then you get out of bed
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,149,"and let me go into it,' said Toad,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,150,'because now I feel terrible.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,151,"Frog said, 'Would you like me"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,152,"to tell you a story, Toad?'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,153,"'Yes,' said Toad, 'if you know one.'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,154,"'Once upon a time,' said Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,155,"'there were two good friends,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,156,"a frog, and a toad. "
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,157,The frog was not feeling well.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,158,He asked his friend the toad
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,159,To tell him a story.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,160,The toad could not think of a story.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,161,"He walked up and down on the porch,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,162,but he could not think of a story.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,163,"He stood on his head,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,164,but he could not think of a story.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,165,"He poured water over his head,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,166,but he could not think of a story.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,167,"He banged his head against the wall,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,168,but he still could not think
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,169,of a story.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,170,"Then the toad did not find so well,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,171,and the frog was feeling better.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,172,So the toad went to bed
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,173,and the frog got up
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,174,and told him a story.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,175,The end.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,176,"How was that,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,177,Toad?' said Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,178,But Toad did not answer.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,179,He had fallen asleep.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,180,A Lost Button
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,181,Toad and Frog
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,182,went for a long walk.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,183,They walked across a large meadow.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,184,They walked in the woods.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,185,They walked along the river.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,186,At last they went back home 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,187,To Toad's house.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,188,"'Oh, frat,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,189,"'Not only do my feet hurt,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,190,but I have lost
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,191,one of the buttons on my jacket.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,192,"'Don't worry,' said Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,193,'We will go back
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,194,to all the places where we walked.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,195,We will soon find your button.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,196,They walked back to the large meadow.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,197,They began to look for the button
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,198,In the tall grass.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,199,'Here is your button!' cried Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,200,"'That is not my button,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,201,'That button is black.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,202,My button was white.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,203,Toad put the black button
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,204,in his pocket.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,205,The sparrow flew down.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,206,"'Excuse me,' said the sparrow."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,207,'Did you lose a button? I found one.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,208,"'That is not my button,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,209,'That button has two holes.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,210,My button had four holes.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,211,Toad put the button with two holes 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,212,in his pocket. 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,213,'They went back to the woods
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,214,and looked on the dark paths.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,215,"'Here is your button,' said Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,216,"'That is not my button,' cried Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,217,'That button is small.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,218,My button was big.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,219,Toad put the small button
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,220,in his pocket.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,221,A raccoon came out from behind a tree.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,222,'I heard that you were looking
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,223,"for a button,' he said."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,224,'Here is one that I just found.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,225,'That is not my button!' wailed Toad.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,226,'That button is square.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,227,My button was round.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,228,Toad put the square button
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,229,in his pocket.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,230,Frog and Toad went back to the river.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,231,They looked for the button
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,232,in the mud.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,233,"'Here is your button,' said Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,234,'That is not my button!' shouted Toad.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,235,'That button is thin.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,236,My button was thick.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,237,Toad put the thin button 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,238,in his pocket. He was very angry.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,239,He jumped up and down
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,240,and screamed.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,241,'The whole world 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,242,"is covered with buttons,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,243,and not one of them is mine!'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,244,Toad ran home and slammed the door.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,245,"There, on the floor,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,246,"he saw his white, four-holed,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,247,"big, round, thick button. "
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,248,"'Oh,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,249,'It was here all the time.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,250,What a lot of trouble
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,251,I have made for Frog.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,252,'Toad took all of the buttons
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,253,out of his pocket.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,254,He took his sewing box
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,255,down from the shelf.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,256,Toad screwed the buttons
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,257,all over his jacket.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,258,The next day Toad gave
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,259,his jacket to Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,260,Frog thought that it was beautiful.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,261,He put it on and jumped for joy.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,262,None of the buttons fell off.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,263,Toad had sewed them on very well.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,264,The Swim
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,265,Toad and Frog
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,266,went down to the river.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,267,"'What a day for a swim,' said Frog. "
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,268,"'Yes,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,269,'I will go behind these rocks
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,270,and put on my bathing suit.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,271,"'I don't wear a bathing suit,'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,272,said Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,273,"'Well, I do,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,274,"'After I put on my bathing suit,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,275,you must not look at me
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,276,until I get into the water.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,277,'Why not?'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,278,asked Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,279,'because I look funny
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,280,in my bathing suit.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,281,"That is why,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,282,Frog closed his eyes when Toad
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,283,came out from behind the rocks.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,284,Toad was wearing his bathing suit.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,285,"'Don't peak,' he said."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,286,Frog and Toad jumped
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,287,into the water.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,288,They swam all afternoon.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,289,Frog swam fast
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,290,and made big splashes.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,291,Toad swam fast
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,292,and made big splashes.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,293,Toad swam slowly
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,294,and made smaller splashes. 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,295,A turtle came along the riverbank.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,296,"'Frog, tell that turtle"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,297,"to go away,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,298,'I do not want him to see me in my bathing suit
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,299,when I come out of the river.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,300,Frog swam over to the turtle
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,301,"'Turtle,' said Frog,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,302,'you will have to go away/'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,303,'Why should I?' asked the turtle.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,304,'Because Toad thinks that
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,305,"he looks funny in his bathing suit,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,306,"and he does not want you to see him,'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,307,said Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,308,Some lizards were sitting nearby/
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,309,'Does Toad really look funny
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,310,in his bathing suit?' they asked.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,311,A snaked crawled out of the grass.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,312,'If Toad looks funny
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,313,"in his bathing suit,' said the snake,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,314,"'then I for one, want to see him.'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,315,"'We want to see him too,'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,316,Said the two dragonflies.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,317,"'Me too,' said the field mouse."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,318,'I have not seen anything funny 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,319,in a long time.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,320,Frog swan back to Toad.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,321,"'I am sorry, Toad,' he said. 'Everyone"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,322,wants to see how you will look.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,323,'Then I will stay right here
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,324,"until they go away,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,325,The turtle and the lizards 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,326,and the snake and the dragonflies
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,327,and the field mouse
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,328,all sat on the riverbank.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,329,They waited for Toad to come
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,330,out of the water.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,331,"'Please,' cried Frog, 'please go away!'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,332,But no one went away.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,333,Toad was getting colder and colder.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,334,He was beginning to shiver and sneeze.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,335,"'I will have to come out of the water,'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,336,Said Toad. 'I am catching a cold.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,337,Toad climbed
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,338,out of the river.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,339,The water dripped
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,340,Out of his bathing suit
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,341,and down onto his feet.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,342,The turtle laughed.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,343,The lizards laughed.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,344,The snake laughed.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,345,"The field mouse laughed,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,346,and frog laughed
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,347,"'What are you laughing at, Frog?'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,348,said Toad.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,349,"'I am laughing at you, Toad,'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,350,"said Frog,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,351,'because you do look funny
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,352,in your bathing suit.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,353,"'Of course I do,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,354,Then he picked up his clothes
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,355,and went home.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,356,The Letter
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,357,Toad was sitting on his front porch.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,358,"Frog came along and said,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,359,'What is the matter Toad?'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,360,You are looking sad.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,361,"'Yes,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,362,'This is my sad time of day.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,363,It is the time
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,364,when I wait for the mail to come.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,365,It always makes me very unhappy.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,366,'Why is that?' asked Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,367,"'because I never get any mail,'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,368,said Toad.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,369,'Not ever?' asked Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,370,"'No, never,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,371,'No one has ever sent me a letter.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,372,Every day my mailbox is empty.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,373,That is why waiting for the mail
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,374,is a sad time for me.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,375,"Frog and Toad sat on the porch, "
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,376,feeling sad together.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,377,"Then Frog said,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,378,"'I have to go home now, Toad.'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,379,There is something that I must do.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,380,Frog hurried home.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,381,He found a pencil
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,382,and a piece of paper.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,383,He wrote on the paper.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,384,He put the paper in an envelope.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,385,On the envelope he wrote
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,386,'A LETTER FOR TOAD.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,387,Frog ran out of his house.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,388,He saw a snail that he knew.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,389,"'Snail,' said Frog, 'please take"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,390,this letter to Toad's house
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,391,and put it in his mailbox.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,392,"'Sure,' said the snail. 'Right away.'"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,393,The Frog ran back to Toad's house.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,394,"Toad was in bed, taking a nap."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,395,"'Toad,' said Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,396,'I think you should get up
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,397,and wait for the mail some more.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,398,"'No,' said Toad, "
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,399,'I'm tired of waiting for the mail.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,400,Frog looked out of the window 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,401,at Toad's mailbox.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,402,The snail was not there yet.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,403,"'Toad,' said Frog, 'you never know"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,404,when someone may send you a letter.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,405,"'No, no,' said Toad. 'I do not think"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,406,anyone will send me a letter.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,407,Frog looked out of the window.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,408,The snail was not there yet.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,409,"'But, Toad,' said Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,410,'someone may send you a letter today.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,411,"'Don't be silly,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,412,'No one has ever sent me
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,413,"a letter before, and no one"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,414,will send me a letter today.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,415,Frog looked out of the window.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,416,The snail was still not there.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,417,"'Frog, why do you keep looking "
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,418,out of the window?' asked Toad.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,419,'Because now I am waiting 
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,420,"for the mail,' said Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,421,"'But there will not be any,' said Toad."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,422,"'Oh yes there will,' said Frog."
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,423,'because I have sent you a letter.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,424,'You have?' said Toad.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,425,'What did you write in the letter?'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,426,"Frog said, 'I wrote"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,427,"Dear Toad, I am glad"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,428,that you are my best friend.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,429,"Your best friend, Frog.''"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,430,"'Oh,' said Toad,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,431,'that makes a very good letter.'
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,432,Then Frog and Toad went out
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,433,onto the front porch
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,434,to wait for the mail.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,435,"They sat there,"
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,436,Feeling happy together.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,437,Frog and Toad waited a long time.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,438,Four days later
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,439,the snail got to Toad's house
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,440,and gave him the letter from Frog.
L184,FROG AND TOAD,ARNOLD LOBEL,441,Toad was very pleased to have it.

L185,GRANDMA WISHES,JULIA LOBO,5,"My heart swelled up with love, my dear,"
L185,GRANDMA WISHES,JULIA LOBO,6,so before I went to bed
L185,GRANDMA WISHES,JULIA LOBO,7,"I wished upon that Grandma Star,"
L185,GRANDMA WISHES,JULIA LOBO,8,and is what I said:

L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,1,Five little puppies dug a hole under the
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,2,"fence and went for a walk in the wide, wide "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,3,world. 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,4,"Through the meadow they went, down"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,5,"the road, over the bridge, across the green"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,6,"grass, and up the hill, one after the other."
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,7,"And when they got to the top of the hill,"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,8,"they counted themselves: one, two, three,"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,9,four. One little puppy wasn't there.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,10,'Now where in the world is that poky 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,11,little puppy?' they wondered. For he cer-
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,12,tainly wasn't on top of the hill.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,13,He wasn't going down the other side.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,14,The only thing they could see going down
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,15,was a fuzzy caterpillar.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,16,He wasn't coming up this side. The only
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,17,thing they could see coming up was a quick
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,18,green lizard. 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,19,But when they looked down at the grassy
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,20,"Place near the bottom of the hill, there he "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,21,"was, running round and round, his nose to"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,22,the ground.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,23,'What is he doing?' the four little puppies
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,24,asked one another. And down they went 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,25,"to see, roly-poly, pell-mell, tumble-bumble,"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,26,till they came to the green grass; and there
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,27,they stopped short.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,28,'What in the world are you doing?' they
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,29,asked.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,30,'I smell something!' said the poky little
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,31,puppy.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,32,Then the four little puppies began to 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,33,"sniff, and they smelled it, too."
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,34,'Rice pudding!' they said.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,35,"And home they went, as fast as they could"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,36,"go, over the bridge, up the road, through "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,37,"the meadow, and under the fence. And"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,38,"there, sure enough, was dinner waiting for"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,39,"them, with rice pudding for dessert. "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,40,But their mother was greatly displeased.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,41,'So you're the little puppies who dig holes
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,42,under fences!' she said. 'No rice pudding
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,43,tonight!' And she made them go straight
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,44,to bed.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,45,But the poky little puppy came home 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,46,after everyone was sound asleep.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,47,he ate up the rice pudding and crawled 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,48,into bed as happy as a lark
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,49,The next morning someone had filled

L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,69,was a big black spider.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,70,He wasn't coming up this side. The only
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,71,thing they could see coming up was a
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,72,brown hop-toad.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,73,But when they looked down at the grassy
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,74,"place near the bottom of the hill, there was"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,75,"the poky little puppy, sitting still as a stone,"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,76,with his head on one side and his ears cocked 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,77,up. 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,78,'What is he doing?' the four little puppies 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,79,asked one another. And down they went
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,80,"to see, roly-poly, pell-mell, tumble-bumble,"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,81,"till they came to the green grass, and there"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,82,they stopped short. 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,83,'What in the world are you doing?' They
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,84,asked.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,85,"'I hear something,' said the poky little puppy."
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,86,"The four little puppies listened, and they"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,87,"could hear it, too. 'Chocolate custard!' they "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,88,cried. 'Someone is spooning it into our
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,89,bowls!'
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,90,And home they went as fast as they could
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,91,"go, over the bridge, up the road, through"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,92,"the meadow, and under the fence. And "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,93,"there, sure enough, was dinner waiting for "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,94,"them, with chocolate custard for dessert."
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,95,But their mother was greatly displeased.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,96,'So you're the little puppies who will dig
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,97,holes under fences!' she said. 'No chocolate
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,98,custard tonight!' And she made them go
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,99,straight to bed.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,100,But the poky little puppy came home
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,101,"after everyone else was sound asleep, and"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,102,he ate up all the chocolate custard and
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,103,crawled into bed as happy as a lark.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,104,"The next morning, someone had filled up"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,105,the hole and put up a sign.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,106,The sign said:
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,107,[[DON'T EVER EVER 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,108,DIG HOLES
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,109,UNDER THIS FENCE!]]
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,110,BUT...
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,111,"In spite of that, the five little puppies "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,112,dug a hole under the fence and went for a
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,113,"walk in the wide, wide world."
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,114,"Through the meadow they went, down "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,115,"the road, over the bridge, across the green"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,116,"grass, and up the hill, two and two. And"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,117,"when they got to the top of the hill, they  "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,118,"counted themselves: one, two, three, four."
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,119,One little puppy wasn't there.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,120,'Now where in the world is that poky
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,121,little puppy?' they wondered. For he 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,122,certainly wasn't on top of the hill.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,123,He wasn't going down the other side.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,124,The only thing they could see going down
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,125,was a little grass snake.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,126,He wasn't coming up this side. The only
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,127,thing they could see coming up was a
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,128,big grasshopper. 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,129,But when they looked down at the grassy 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,130,"place near the bottom of the hill, there he"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,131,"was, looking hard at something on the "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,132,ground in front of him.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,133,'What is he doing?' the four little puppies 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,134,asked one another. And down they went 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,135,"to see, roly-poly, pell-mell, tumble-bumble, "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,136,till they came to the green grass; and there 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,137,they stopped short.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,138,'What in the world are you doing?' they
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,139,asked.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,140,'I see something!' said the poky little
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,141,puppy.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,142,"The four little puppies looked, and they "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,143,"could see it, too. It was a ripe, red strawberry"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,144,growing there in the grass.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,145,'Strawberry shortcake!' they cried.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,146,And home they went as fast as they could 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,147,"go, over the bridge, up the road, through "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,148,"the meadow, and under the fence. And "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,149,"there, sure enough, was dinner waiting for"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,150,"them, with strawberry shortcake for dessert."
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,151,But their mother said: 'So you're the little
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,152,puppies who dug that hole under the fence 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,153,again! No strawberry shortcake for supper 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,154,tonight!' And she made them go straight 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,155,to bed.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,156,But the four little puppies waited till
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,157,"they thought she was asleep, and then they"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,158,"slipped out and filled up the hole, and when"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,159,"they turned around, there was their mother"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,160,watching them. 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,161,'What good little puppies!' she said.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,162,'Come have some strawberry shortcake!'
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,163,"And this time, when the poky little puppy "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,164,"got home, he had to squeeze in through a"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,165,wide place in the fence. And there were his
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,166,"four brother and sisters, licking the last "
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,167,crumbs from their saucer. 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,168,'Dear me!' said his mother. 'What a 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,169,pity you're so poky! Now the strawberry
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,170,shortcake is all gone!'
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,171,So the poky little puppy had to go to bed 
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,172,"without a single bite of shortcake, and he"
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,173,felt very sorry for himself.
L186,THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY,JANETTE SEBRING LOWRY,174,"And the next morning, someone had put "

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,2,Hand in hand we come
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,3,Christopher Robin and I
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,4,To lay this book in your lap.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,5,Say you're surprised?
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,6,Say you like it?
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,7,Say it's just what you wanted?
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,8,Because it's yours- Because we love you.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,9,Introduction
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,10,"If you happen to have read another book about Christopher Robin, you may"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,11,"remember that he once had a swan (or the swan had Christopher Robin, I don't"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,12,"know which) and that he used to call this swan Pooh. That was a long time ago,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,13,"and when we said good-bye, we took the name with us, as we didn't think the swan"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,14,"would want it any more. Well, when Edward Bear said that he would like an"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,15,"exciting name all to himself, Christopher Robin said at once, without stopping"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,16,"to think, that he was Winnie-the.Pooh. And he was. So, as I have explained the"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,17,"Pooh part, I will now explain the rest of it."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,18,You can't be in London for long
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,19,without going to the Zoo. There are some people who begin the Zoo at the
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,20,"beginning, called WAYIN, and walk as quickly as they can past every cage"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,21,"until they get to the one called WA YOUT, but the nicest people go straight"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,22,"to the animal they love the most, and stay there. So when Christopher Robin"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,23,"goes to the Zoo, he goes to where the Polar Bears are, and he whispers"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,24,"something to the third keeper from the left, and doors are unlocked, and we"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,25,"wander through dark passages and up steep stairs, until at last we come to"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,26,"the special cage, and the cage is opened, and out trots something brown and"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,27,"furry, and with a happy cry of ""Oh, Bear!"" Christopher Robin rushes into its"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,28,"arms. Now this bear's name is Winnie, which shows what a good name for bears"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,29,"it is, but the funny thing is that we can't remember whether Winnie is called"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,30,"after Pooh, or Pooh after Winnie. We did know once, but we have"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,31,forgotten. . . . I had written as far as this when Piglet looked up and said
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,32,"in his squeaky voice, ""What about Me?"" ""My dear Piglet,"" I said, ""the whole"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,33,"book is about you."" ""So it is about Pooh,"" he squeaked. You see what it is."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,34,He is jealous because he thinks Pooh is having a Grand Introduction all to
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,35,"himself. Pooh is the favorite, of course, there's no denying it, but Piglet"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,36,comes in for a good many things which Pooh misses; because you can't take
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,37,"Pooh to school without everybody knowing it, but Piglet is so small that he"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,38,"slips into a pocket, where it is very comfortable to feel him when you are"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,39,not quite sure whether twice seven is twelve or twenty-two. Sometimes he
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,40,"slips out and has a good look in the ink-pot, and in this way he has got more"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,41,"education than Pooh, but Pooh doesn't mind. Some have brains, and some haven't,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,42,"he says, and there it is."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,43,"And now all the others are saying, ""What about Us?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,44,So perhaps the best thing to do is to stop writing Introductions and get on
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,45,with the book.

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,52,"coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there really is another way, if"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,53,only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it. And then he feels that
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,54,"perhaps there isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready to be"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,55,introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,56,"When I first heard his name, I said, just"

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,58,Christopher Robin.

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,65,the explanation you are going to get.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,66, Sometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,67,"some sort when he comes downstairs, and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,68,front of the fire and listen to a story. This evening-.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,69,"""What about a story?"" said Christopher Robin."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,70,"""What about a story?"" I said."

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,76,"Once upon a time, a very long"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,77,"time ago now, about last Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by"

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,79,"(""What does 'under the name' mean)"" asked Christopher Robin. ""It means he had"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,80,"the name over the door in gold letters, and lived under it."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,81,"""Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure,"" said Christopher Robin."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,82,WE ARE INTRODUCED
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,83,"(Now I am, ""said a growly voice."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,84,"""Then I will go on,"" said I.)"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,85,"One day when he was out walking, he came to an"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,86,"open place in the middle of the forest, and in the"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,87,"middle of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,88,"the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,89,noise.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,90,Winnie-the-Pooh sat own at the foot of the
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,91,"tree, put his head between his paws and began to"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,92,think.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,93,"First of all he said to himself: ""That buzzing-noise"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,94,means something. You don't get a buzzing noise like
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,95,"that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,96,"something. If there's a buzzing -noise, somebody's"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,97,"making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,98,"a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you're a bee."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,99,"Then he thought another long time, and said:"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,100,"""And the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,101,"And then he got up, and said: ""And the only reason for making honey is so as"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,102,"I can eat it."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,103,So he began to climb the tree.

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,105,climbed

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,115,climbed
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,116,he
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,117,sang
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,118,a
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,119,little
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,120,song
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,121,to
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,122,himself.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,123,It
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,124,went
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,125,like
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,126,this:
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,127,isn't it funny
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,128,How bear likes honey?
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,129,Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,130,I wonder why he does?
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,131,Then he climbed little further...
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,132,and a little further...and then just a little further. By that time
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,133,he had thought of another song.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,134,"It's a very funny thought that, if Beas were Bees,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,135,They'd build their nests at the bottom of trees.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,136,"And that being so (if the Bees were Bears),"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,137,We shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,138,"He was getting rather tired by this time, so that is why he sang a Complaining"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,139,"Song.He was nearly there now, and if he just stood on that branch..."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,140,Crack!
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,141,"""Oh, help!"" said Pooh, as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,142,"""If only I hadn't--"" he said, as he bounced"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,143,"twenty feet on to the next branch. ""You see, what I meant to do,"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,144,"he explained,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,145,"as he turned head-over-heels, and crashed on to another branch thirty feet"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,146,"below, ""what I meant to do--"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,147,"""Of course, it was rather--"" he admitted, as he slithered very quickly"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,148,through the next six branches.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,149,"""It all comes, I suppose,"" he decided, as he said good-bye to the last branch,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,150,"spun round three times, and flew gracefully into a gorse-bush,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,151,"""it all comes of liking honey so much. Oh, help!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,152,"He crawled out of the gorse-bush, brushed the prickles from his nose,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,153,and began to think again. And the first person he thought of was Christopher
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,154,Robin.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,155,"(""Was that me?"" said Christopher Robin in an awed voice, hardly daring to"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,156,"believe it. h  was you. ""Christopher Robin said nothing, but his eyes got"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,157,"larger and larger, and his face got pinker and pinker.)"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,158,"So Winnie-the-Pooh went round to his friend Christopher Robin, who lived"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,159,behind a green door in another part of the forest.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,160,"""Good morning, Christopher Robin,"" he said."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,161,"""Good morning, Winnie-ther-Pooh,"" said you."

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,168,"Winnie-the-Pooh looked around to see that nobody was listening, put his paw"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,169,"to his mouth, and said in a deep whisper: ""Honey!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,170,"""But you don't get honey"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,171,"with balloons!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,172,"""I do,"" said Pooh."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,173,"Well , it just happened that you had been to a party"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,174,"the day before at the house of your friend Piglet, and"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,175,you had balloons at the party. You had had a big green balloon; and one of
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,176,Rabbit's relations had had
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,177," a big blue one, and had left it behind,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,178,being really too young to go to a party at all; and so you had brought the

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,180,"Which one would you like""you asked"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,181,Pooh.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,182,He put his head between his paws and thought very carefully.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,183,"""It's like this,"" he said. ""When you go after honey"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,184,"with a balloon,"

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,189,"""Wouldn't they notice you underneath the balloon?"" you asked."

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,195,"with you,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,196,"just in case, as you al.ways did, and Winnie -the-Pooh went to a very muddy"

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,310,"EDWARD BEAR, known to his friends as Winnie-the-Pooh, or Pooh for short, was walking through the forest one day, humming proudly to himself. He had made up a little hum that very morning, as he was doing his Stoutness Exercises in front of the glass: Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, as he stretched up as high as he could go, and then Tra-la-la, tra-la - oh, help! - la, as he tried to reach his toes. After breakfast he had said it over and over to himself until he had learnt it off by heart, and now he was humming it right through, properly. It went like this:"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,311,"Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum, Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle, Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle, Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,312,"Well, he was humming this hum to himself, and walking along gaily, wondering what everybody else was doing, and what it felt like, being somebody else, when suddenly he came to a sandy bank, and in the bank was a large hole."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,313,"""Aha!"" said Pooh. (Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum.) ""If I know anything about anything, that hole means Rabbit,"" he said, ""and Rabbit means Company,"" he said, ""and Company means Food and Listening-to-Me Humming and such like. Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,314,"So he bent down, put his head into the hole, and called out: ""Is anybody at home?"" There was suddenly a scuffling noise from inside the hole, and then silence. ""What I said was, 'Is anybody at home?'"" called out Pooh very loudly."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,315,"""No!"" said a voice; and then added, ""you needn't shout so loud. I heard you quite well the first time."""

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,329,"""Oh, well, then, come in."" So Pooh pushed and pushed and pushed his way through the hole, and at last he got in. ""You were quite right,"" said Rabbit, looking at him all over. ""It is you. Glad"

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,331,"""Who did you think it was?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,332,"""Well, I wasn't sure. You know how it is in the Forest. One can't have anybody coming into one's house. One has to be careful. What about a mouthful of something?"" Pooh always liked a little something at eleven o'clock in the morning, and he was very glad to see Rabbit getting out the plates and mugs; and when Rabbit said, ""Honey or condensed milk with your bread?"" he was so excited that he said, ""Both,"" and then, so as not to seem greedy, he added, ""but don't bother about the bread, please."" And for a long time after that he said nothing ... until at last, humming to himself in a rather sticky voice, he got up, shook Rabbit lovingly by the paw, and said that he must be going on."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,333,"""Must you?"" said Rabbit politely."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,334,"""Well,"" said Pooh, ""I could stay a little longer if it - if you -"" and he tried very hard to look in the direction of the larder."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,335,"""As a matter of fact,"" said Rabbit, ""I was going out myself directly."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,336,"""Oh, well, then, I'll be going on. Good-bye."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,337,"""Well, good-bye, if you're sure you won't have anymore."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,338,"""Is there any more?"" asked Pooh quickly."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,339,"Rabbit took the covers off the dishes, and said no, there wasn't."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,340,"""I thought not,"" said Pooh, nodding to himself. ""Well, good-bye. I must be going on."" So he started to climb out of the hole. He pulled with his front paws, and pushed with his back paws, and in a little while his nose was out in the open again ... and then his ears ... and then his front paws ... and then his shoulders ... and then - ""Oh, help!"" said Pooh. ""I'd better go back."" ""Oh, bother"" said Pooh. ""I shall have to go on."" ""I can't do either!"" said Pooh. ""Oh, help and bother!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,341,"Now by this time Rabbit wanted to go for a walk too, and finding the front door full, he went out by the back door, and came round to Pooh, and looked at him. ""Hallo, are you stuck?"" he asked."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,342,"""N-no,"" said Pooh carelessly. ""Just resting and thinking and humming to myself."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,343,"""Here, give us a paw."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,344,"Pooh Bear stretched out a paw, and Rabbit pulled and pulled and pulled... ""Ow!"" cried Pooh. ""You're hurting!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,345,"""The fact is,"" said Rabbit, ""you're stuck."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,346,"""It all comes,"" said Pooh crossly, ""of not having front doors big enough."""

""Well, well, I shall go and fetch Christopher Robin."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,348,"Christopher Robin lived at he other end of the Forest, and when he came back with Rabbit, and saw the front half of Pooh, he said, ""Silly old Bear,"" in such a loving voice that everybody felt quite hopeful again."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,349,"""I was just beginning to think,"" said Bear, sniffing slightly, ""that Rabbit might never be able to use his front door again. And I should hate that,"" he said."

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,357,Christopher Robin nodded.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,358,"""There's only one thing to be done,"" he said. ""We shall have to wait for you to get thin again."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,359,"""How long does getting thin take?"" asked Pooh anxiously."

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,362,"""You can stay here all right, silly old Bear. It's getting you out which is so difficult."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,363,"""We'll read to you,"" said Rabbit cheerfully. ""And I hope it won't snow,"" he added. ""And I say, old fellow, you're taking up a good deal of room in my house - do you mind if I use your back legs as a towel-horse? Because, I mean, there they are - doing nothing - and it would be very convenient just to hang the towels on them."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,364,"""A week!"" said Pooh gloomily. ""What about meals?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,365,"""I'm afraid no meals,"" said Christopher Robin, ""because of getting thin quicker. But we will read to you."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,366,"Bear began to sigh, and then found he couldn't because he was so tightly stuck; and a tear rolled down his eye, as he said: ""Then would you read a Sustaining Book, such as would help and comfort a Wedged Bear in Great Tightness?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,367,"So for a week Christopher Robin read that sort of book at the North end of Pooh, and Rabbit hung his washing on the South end... and in between Bear felt himself getting slenderer and slenderer. And at the end of the week Christopher Robin said, ""Now!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,368,"So he took hold of Pooh's front paws and Rabbit took hold of Christopher Robin, and all Rabbit's friends and relations took hold of Rabbit, and they all pulled together..."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,369,"And for a long time Pooh only said ""Ow!""... And ""Oh!""... And then, all of a sudden, he said ""Pop!"" just as if a cork were coming out of a bottle."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,370,"And Christopher Robin and Rabbit and all Rabbit's friends and relations went head-over-heels backwards ... and on the top of them came Winnie-the-Pooh - free! So, with a nod of thanks to his friends, he went on with his walk through the forest, humming proudly to himself. But, Christopher Robin looked after him lovingly, and said to himself, ""Silly old Bear!"""

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,372,In Which Pooh and Piglet Go Hunting and Nearly Catch a Woozle
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,373,"THE PIGLET lived in a very grand house in the middle of a a beech-tree, and the beech-tree was in the middle of the forest, and the Piglet lived in the middle of the house. Next to his house was a piece of broken board which had: ""TRESPASSERS W"" on it. When Christopher Robin asked the Piglet what it meant, he said it was his grandfather's name, and had been in the family for a long time. Christopher Robin said you couldn't be called Trespassers W, and Piglet said yes, you could, because his grandfather was, and it was short for Trespassers Will, which was short for Trespassers William. And his grandfather had had two names in case he lost one - Trespassers after an uncle, and William after Trespassers."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,374,"""I've got two names,"" said Christopher Robin carelessly."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,375,"""Well, there you are, that proves it,"" said Piglet. One fine winter's day when Piglet was brushing away the snow in front of his house, he happened to look up, and there was Winnie-the-Pooh. Pooh was walking round and round in a circle, thinking of something else, and when Piglet called to him, he just went on walking."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,376,"""Hallo!"" said Piglet, ""what are you doing?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,377,"""Hunting,"" said Pooh."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,378,"""Hunting what?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,379,"""Tracking something,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh very mysteriously."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,380,"""Tracking what?"" said Piglet, coming closer."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,381,"""That's just what I ask myself. I ask myself, What?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,382,"""What do you think you'll answer?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,383,"""I shall have to wait until I catch up with it,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh. ""Now, look there."" He pointed to the ground in front of him. ""What do you see there?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,384,"""Tracks,"" said Piglet. ""Paw-marks."" He gave a little squeak of excitement. ""Oh, Pooh! Do you think it's a - a - a Woozle?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,385,"""It may be,"" said Pooh. ""Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. You can never tell with paw-marks."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,386,"With these few words he went on tracking, and Piglet, after watching him for a minute or two, ran after him. Winnie-the-Pooh had come to a sudden stop, and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled sort of way."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,387,"""What's the matter?"" asked Piglet."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,388,"""It's a very funny thing,"" said Bear, ""but there seem to be two animals now. This - whatever-it-was - has been joined by another - whatever-it-is - and the two of them are now proceeding in company. Would you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case they turn out to be Hostile Animals?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,389,"Piglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way, and said that he had nothing to do until Friday, and would be delighted to come, in case it really was a Woozle."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,390,"""You mean, in case it really is two Woozles,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh, and Piglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until Friday. So off they went together."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,391,"There was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and it seemed as if the two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round this spinney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet after them, Piglet passing the time by telling Pooh what his Grandfather Trespassers W had done to Remove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his Grandfather Trespassers W had suffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath, and other matters of interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was like, and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now, and, if so, whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it, and what Christopher Robin would say. And still the tracks went on in front of them..."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,392,"Suddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped and pointed excitedly in front of him. ""Look!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,393,"""What?"" said Piglet, with a jump. And then, to show that he hadn't been frightened, he jumped up and down once or twice in an exercising sort of way."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,394,"""The tracks!"" said Pooh. ""A third animal has joined the other two!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,395,"""Pooh!"" cried Piglet. ""Do you think it is another Woozle?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,396,"""No,"" said Pooh, ""because it makes different marks. It is either Two Woozles and one, as it might be, Wizzle, or Two, as it might be, Wizzles and one, if so it is, Woozle. Let us continue to follow them."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,397,"So they went on, feeling just a little anxious now, in case the three animals in front of them were of Hostile Intent. And Piglet wished very much that his Grandfather T. W. were there, instead of elsewhere, and Pooh thought how nice it would be if they met Christopher Robin suddenly but quite accidentally, and only because he liked Christopher Robin so much. And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-the-Pooh stopped again, and licked the tip of his nose in a cooling manner, for he was feeling more hot and anxious than ever in his life before. There were four animals in front of them!"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,398,"""Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three, as it were, Woozles, and one, as it was, Wizzle. Another Woozle has joined them!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,399,"And so it seemed to be. There were the tracks; crossing over each other here, getting muddled up with each other there; but, quite plainly every now and then, the tracks of four sets of paws."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,400,"""I think,"" said Piglet, when he had licked the tip of his nose too, and found that it brought very little comfort, ""I think that I have just remembered something. I have just remembered something that I forgot to do yesterday and shan't be able to do tomorrow. So I suppose I really ought to go back and do it now."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,401,"""We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with you,"" said Pooh."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,402,"""It isn't the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon,"" said Piglet quickly. ""It's a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in the morning, and, if possible, between the hours of - What would you say the time was?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,403,"""About twelve,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh, looking at the sun."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,404,"""Between, as I was saying, the hours of twelve and twelve five. So, really, dear old Pooh, if you'll excuse me - What's that?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,405,"Pooh looked up at the sky, and then, as he heard the whistle again, he looked up into the branches of a big oak-tree, and then he saw a friend of his."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,406,"""It's Christopher Robin,"" he said."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,407,"""Ah, then you'll be all right,"" said Piglet. ""You'll be quite safe with him. Good-bye,"" and he trotted off home as quickly as he could, very glad to be Out of All Danger again."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,408,Christopher Robin came slowly down his tree.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,409,"""Silly old Bear,"" he said, ""what were you doing? First you went round the spinney twice by yourself, and then Piglet ran after you and you went round again together, and then you were just going round a fourth time -"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,410,"""Wait a moment,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh, holding up his paw."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,411,"He sat down and thought, in the most thoughtful way he could think. Then he fitted his paw into one of the Tracks ... and then he scratched his nose twice, and stood up."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,412,"""Yes,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,413,"""I see now,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,414,"""I have been Foolish and Deluded,"" said he, ""and I am a Bear of No Brain at All."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,415,"""You're the Best Bear in All the World,"" said Christopher Robin soothingly."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,416,"""Am I?"" said Pooh hopefully. And then he brightened up suddenly."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,417,"""Anyhow,"" he said, ""it is nearly Luncheon Time."" So he went home for it."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,418,CHAPTER IV
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,419,In Which Eeyore Loses a Tail and Pooh Finds One
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,420,"The old grey donkey, Eeyore, stood by himself in a thistly corner of the forest, his front feet well apart, his head on one side, and thought about things. Sometimes he thought sadly to himself, ""Why?"" and sometimes he thought, ""Wherefore?"" and sometimes he thought, ""Inasmuch as which?"" - and sometimes he didn't quite know what he was thinking about. So when Winnie-the-Pooh came stumping along, Eeyore was very glad to be able to stop thinking for a little, in order to say ""How do you do?"" in a gloomy manner to him."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,421,"""And how are you?"" said Winnie-the-Pooh."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,422,"Eeyore shook his head from side to side. ""Not very how,"" he said. ""I don't seem to have felt at all how for a long time."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,423,"""Dear, dear,"" said Pooh, ""I'm sorry about that. Let's have a look at you."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,424,"So Eeyore stood there, gazing sadly at the ground, and Winnie-the-Pooh walked all round him once. ""Why, what's happened to your tail?"" he said in surprise."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,425,"""What has happened to it?"" said Eeyore."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,426,"""It isn't there!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,427,"""Are you sure?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,428,"""Well, either a tail is there or it isn't there. You can't make a mistake about it. And yours isn't there!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,429,"""Then what is?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,430,"""Nothing."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,431,"""Let's have a look,"" said Eeyore, and he turned slowly round to the place where his tail had been a little while ago, and then, finding that he couldn't catch it up, he turned round the other way, until he came back to where he was at first, and then he put his head down and looked between his front legs, and at last he said, with a long, sad sigh, ""I believe you're right."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,432,"""Of course I'm right,"" said Pooh."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,433,"""That Accounts for a Good Deal,"" said Eeyore gloomily. ""It Explains Everything. No Wonder."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,434,"""You must have left it somewhere,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,435,"""Somebody must have taken it,"" said Eeyore. ""How Like Them,"" he added, after a long silence."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,436,"Pooh felt that he ought to say something helpful about it, but didn't quite know what. So he decided to do something helpful instead."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,437,"""Eeyore,"" he said solemnly, ""I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for you."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,438,"""Thank you, Pooh,"" answered Eeyore. ""You're a real friend,"" said he. ""Not like Some,"" he said."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,439,"So Winnie-the-Pooh went off to find Eeyore's tail. It was a fine spring morning in the forest as he started out. Little soft clouds played happily in a blue sky, skipping from time to time in front of the sun as if they had come to put it out, and then sliding away suddenly so that the next might have his turn. Through them and between them the sun shone bravely; and a copse which had worn its firs all the year round seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace which the beeches had put on so prettily. Through copse and spinney marched Bear; down open slopes of gorse and heather, over rocky beds of streams, up steep banks of sandstone into the heather again; and so at last, tired and hungry, to the Hundred Acre Wood. For it was in the Hundred Acre Wood that Owl lived."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,440,"""And if anyone knows anything about anything,"" said Bear to himself, ""it's Owl who knows something about something,"" he said, ""or my name's not Winnie-the-Pooh,"" he said. ""Which it is,"" he added. ""So there you are."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,441,"Owl lived at The Chestnuts, an old-world residence of great charm, which was grander than anybody else's, or seemed so to Bear, because it had both a knocker and a bell-pull. Underneath the knocker there was a notice which said: PLES RING IF AN RNSER IS REQIRD."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,442,Underneath the bell-pull there was a notice which said: PLEZ CNOKE IF AN RNSR IS NOT REQID.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,443,"These notices had been written by Christopher Robin, who was the only one in the forest who could spell; for Owl, wise though he was in many ways, able to read and write and spell his own name WOL, yet somehow went all to pieces over delicate words like MEASLES and BUTTERED TOAST."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,444,"Winnie-the-Pooh read the two notices very carefully, first from left to right, and afterwards, in case he had missed some of it, from right to left. Then, to make quite sure, he knocked and pulled the knocker, and he pulled and knocked the bell-rope, and he called out in a very loud voice, ""Owl! I require an answer! It's Bear speaking."""" And the door opened, and Owl looked out."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,445,"""Hallo, Pooh,"" he said. ""How's things?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,446,"""Terrible and Sad,"" said Pooh, ""because Eeyore, who is a friend of mine, has lost his tail. And he's Moping about it. So could you very kindly tell me how to find it for him?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,447,"""Well,"" said Owl, ""the customary procedure in such cases is as follows."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,448,"""What does Crustimoney Proseedcake mean?"" said Pooh. ""For I am a Bear of Very Little Brain, and long words Bother me."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,449,"""It means the Thing to Do."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,450,"""As long as it means that, I don't mind,"" said Pooh humbly."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,451,"""The thing to do is as follows. First, Issue a Reward. Then -"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,452,"""Just a moment,"" said Pooh, holding up his paw."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,453,"""What do we do to this - what you were saying? You sneezed just as you were going to tell me."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,454,"""I didn't sneeze."""

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,460,"""A Reward!"" said Owl very loudly. ""We write a notice to say that we will give a large something to anybody who finds Eeyore's tail."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,461,"""I see, I see,"" said Pooh, nodding his head. ""Talking about large somethings,"" he went on dreamily, ""I generally have a small something about now - about this time in the morning,"" and he looked wistfully at the cupboard in the corner of Owl's parlour; ""just a mouthful of condensed milk or what not, with perhaps a lick of honey -"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,462,"""Well, then,"" said Owl, ""we write out this notice, and we put it up all over the forest."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,463,"""A lick of honey,"" murmured Bear to himself, ""or - or not, as the case may be."" And he gave a deep sigh, and tried very hard to listen to what Owl was saying."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,464,"But Owl went on and on, using longer and longer words, until at last he came back to where he started, and he explained that the person to write out this notice was Christopher Robin."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,465,"""It was he who wrote the ones on my front door for me. Did you see them, Pooh?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,466,"For some time now Pooh had been saying ""Yes"" and ""No"" in turn, with his eyes shut, to all that Owl was saying, and having said, ""Yes, yes,"" last time, he said ""No, not at all,"" now, without really knowing what Owl was talking about."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,467,"""Didn't you see them?"" said Owl, a little surprised. ""Come and look at them now."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,468,"So they went outside. And Pooh looked at the knocker and the notice below it, and he looked at the bell-rope and the notice below it, and the more he looked at the bell-rope, the more he felt that he had seen something like it, somewhere else, sometime before."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,469,"""Handsome bell-rope, isn't it?"" said Owl."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,470,Pooh nodded.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,471,"""It reminds me of something,"" he said, ""but I can't think what. Where did you get it?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,472,"""I just came across it in the Forest. It was hanging over a bush, and I thought at first somebody lived there, so I rang it, and nothing happened, and then I rang it again very loudly, and it came off in my hand, and as nobody seemed to want it, I took it home, and -"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,473,"""Owl,"" said Pooh solemnly, ""you made a mistake. Somebody did want it."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,474,"""Who?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,475,"""Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore. He was - he was fond of it."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,476,"""Fond of it?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,477,"""Attached to it,"" said Winnie-the-Pooh sadly."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,478,"So with these words he unhooked it, and carried it back to Eeyore; and when Christopher Robin had nailed it on in its right place again, Eeyore frisked about the forest, waving his tail so happily that Winnie-the-Pooh came over all funny, and had to hurry home for a little snack of something to sustain him. And, wiping his mouth half an hour afterwards, he sang to himself proudly:"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,479,Who found the Tail?
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,480,"""I,"" said Pooh, ""At a quarter to two"

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,485,Piglet Meets a Heffalump
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,486,"ONE DAY, when Christopher Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet were all talking together, Christopher Robin finished the mouthful he was eating and said carelessly: ""I saw a Heffalump to-day, Piglet."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,487,"""What was it doing?"" asked Piglet."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,488,"""Just lumping along,"" said Christopher Robin. ""I don't think it saw me."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,489,"""I saw one once,"" said Piglet. ""At least, I think I did,"" he said. ""Only perhaps it wasn't."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,490,"""So did I,"" said Pooh, wondering what a Heffalump was like."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,491,"""You don't often see them,"" said Christopher Robin carelessly."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,492,"""Not now,"" said Piglet."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,493,"""Not at this time of year,"" said Pooh."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,494,"Then they all talked about something else, until it was time for Pooh and Piglet to go home together. At first as they stumped along the path which edged the Hundred Acre Wood, they didn't say much to each other' but when they came to the stream and had helped each other across the stepping stones, and were able to walk side by side again over the heather, they began to talk in a friendly way about this and that, and Piglet said,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,495,"""If you see what I mean, Pooh,"" and Pooh said,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,496,"""It's just what I think myself, Piglet,"" and Piglet said,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,497,"""But, on the other hand, Pooh, we must remember,"" and Pooh said"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,498,"""Quite true, Piglet, although I had forgotten it for the moment."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,499,"And then, just as they came to the Six Pine Trees, Pooh looked round to see that nobody else was listening, and said in a very solemn voice:"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,500,"""Piglet, I have decided something."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,501,"""What have you decided, Pooh?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,502,"""I have decided to catch a Heffalump."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,503,"Pooh nodded his head several times as he said this, and waited for Piglet to say ""How?"" or ""Pooh, you couldn't"" or something helpful of that sort, but Piglet said nothing. The fact was Piglet was wishing that he had thought about it first."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,504,"""I shall do it,"" said Pooh, after waiting a little longer, ""by means of a trap. And it must be a Cunning Trap, so you will have to help me, Piglet."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,505,"""Pooh,"" said Piglet, feeling quite happy again now, ""I will."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,506,"And then he said, ""How shall we do it?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,507,"And Pooh said, ""That's just it. How?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,508,And then they sat down together to think it out.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,509,"Pooh's first idea was that they should dig a Very Deep Pit, and then the Heffalump would come along and fall into the Pit, and-"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,510,"""Why?"" said Piglet."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,511,"""Why what?"" said Pooh."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,512,"""Why would he fall in?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,513,"Pooh rubbed his nose with his paw, and said that the Heffalump might be walking along, humming a little song, and looking up at the sky, wondering if it would rain, and so he wouldn't see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way down, when it would be too late."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,514,"Piglet said that this was a very good Trap, but supposing it were raining already?"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,515,"Pooh rubbed his nose again, and said that he hadn't thought of that. And then he brightened up, and said that, if it were raining already, the Heffalump would be looking at the sky wondering if it would clear up, and so he wouldn't see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way down...¦. When it would be too late."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,516,"Piglet said that, now that this point had been explained, he thought it was a Cunning Trap."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,517,"Pooh was very proud when he heard this, and he felt that the Heffalump was as good as caught already, but there was just one other thing which had to be thought about, and it was this. Where should they dig the Very Deep Pit?"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,518,"Piglet said that the best place would be somewhere where a Heffalump was, just before he fell into it, only about a foot farther on."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,519,"""But then he would see us digging it,"" said Pooh."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,520,"""Not if he was looking at the sky."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,521,"""He would suspect,"" said Pooh, ""if he happened to look down."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,522,"He thought for a long time and then added sadly, ""It isn't as easy as I thought. I suppose that's why Heffalumps hardly ever get caught."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,523,"""That must be it,"" said Piglet."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,524,"They sighed and got up; and when they had taken a few gorse prickles out of themselves they sat down again' and all the time Pooh was saying to himself, ""If only I could think of something!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,525,For he felt sure that a Very Clever Brain could catch a Heffalump if only he knew the right way to go about it.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,526,"""Suppose,"" he said to Piglet, ""you wanted to catch me, how would you do it?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,527,"""Well,"" said Piglet, ""I should do it like this. I should make a Trap, and I should put a Jar of Honey in the Trap, and you would smell it, and you would go in after it, and-"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,528,"""And I would go in after it,"" said Pooh excitedly, ""only very carefully so as not to hurt myself, and I would get to the Jar of Honey, and I should lick round the edges first of all, pretending that there wasn't any more, you know, and then I should walk away and think about it a little, and then I should come back and start licking in the middle of the jar, and then-"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,529,"""Yes, well never mind about that. There you would be, and there I should catch you. Now the first thing to think of is, What do Heffalumps like? I should think acorns, shouldn't you? We'll get a lot of-I say, wake up, Pooh!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,530,"Pooh, who had gone into a happy dream, woke up with a start, and said that Honey was a much more trappy thing than Haycorns. Piglet didn't think so; and they were just going to argue about it, when Piglet remembered that, if they put acorns in the Trap, he would have to find the acorns, but if they put honey, then Pooh would have to give up some of his own honey, so he said, ""All right, honey then,"" just as Pooh remembered it too, and was going to say, ""All right, haycorns."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,531,"""Honey,"" said Piglet to himself in a thoughtful way, as if it were now settled."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,532,"""I'll dig the pit, while you go and get the honey."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,533,"""Very well,"" said Pooh, and he stumped off."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,534,"As soon as he got home, he went to the larder; and he stood on a chair, and took down a very large jar of honey from the top shelf. It had HUNNY written on it, but, just to make sure, he took off the paper cover and looked at it, and it looked just like honey."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,535,"""But you never can tell,"" said Pooh. ""I remember my uncle saying once that he had seen cheese just this colour."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,536,"So he put his tongue in, and took a large lick."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,537,"""Yes,"" he said, ""it is. No doubt about that. And honey, I should say, right down to the bottom of the jar. Unless, of course,"" he said ""somebody put cheese in at the bottom just for a joke. Perhaps I had better go a little further...¦ just in case...¦ in case Heffalumps don't like cheese...¦ same as me...¦Ah!"" And he gave a deep sigh. ""I was right. It is honey, right the way down."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,538,"Having made certain of this, he took the jar back to Piglet, and Piglet looked up from the bottom of his Very Deep Pit, and said ""Got it?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,539,"and Pooh said, ""Yes, but it isn't quite a full jar,"" and he threw it down to Piglet, and Piglet said"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,540,"""No, it isn't! Is that all you've got left?"" and Pooh said"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,541,"""Yes."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,542,"Because it was. So Piglet put the jar at the bottom of the Pit, and climbed out, and they went off home together."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,543,"""Well, good night, Pooh,"" said Piglet, when they had got to Pooh's house. ""And we meet at six o'clock tomorrow morning by the Pine Trees, and see how many Heffalumps we've got in out Trap."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,544,"""Six o'clock, Piglet. And have you got any string?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,545,"""No. Why do you want string?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,546,"""To lead them home with."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,547,"""Oh!... I think Heffalumps come if you whistle."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,548,"""Some do and some don't. You never can tell with Heffalumps. Well, good night!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,549,"""Good night!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,550,"And off Piglet trotted to his house, TRESPASSERS W, while Pooh made his preparations for bed."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,551,"Some hours later, just as the night was beginning to steal away, Pooh woke up suddenly with a sinking feeling. He had had that sinking feeling before, and he knew what it meant. He was hungry. So he went to the larder, and he stood on a chair and reached up to the top shelf, and found-nothing."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,552,"""That's funny,"" he thought. ""I know I had a jar of honey there. A full jar, full of honey right up to the top, and it had HUNNY written on it, so that I should know it was honey. That's very funny."" And then he began to wander up and down, wondering where it was and murmuring a murmur to himself."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,553,Like this:
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,554,"It's very, very funny,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,555,'Cos I know I had some honey;
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,556,"'Cos it had a label on,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,557,Saying HUNNY.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,558,"A goloptious full-up pot too,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,559,"And I don't know where it's gone to,"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,560,No I don't know where it's gone-
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,561,"Well, it's funny."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,562,"He had murmured this to himself three times in a singing sort of way, when suddenly he remembered. He had put it into the Cunning Trap to catch the Heffalump."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,563,"""Bother!"" said Pooh. ""It all comes of trying to be kind to Heffalumps."" And he got back into bed."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,564,"But he couldn't sleep. The more he tried to sleep, the more he couldn't He tried Counting Sheep, which is sometimes a good way of getting to sleep, and, as that was no good, he tried counting Heffalumps. And that was worse. Because every Heffalump that he counted was making straight for a pot of Pooh's honey, and eating it all. For some minutes he lay there miserably, but when the five hundred and eighty-seventh Heffalump was licking its jaws, and saying to itself, ""Very good honey this, I don't know when I've tasted better,"" Pooh could bear it no longer. He jumped out of bed, he ran out of the house, and he ran straight to the Six Pine Trees."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,565,"The Sun was still in bed, but there was a lightness in the sky over the Hundred Acre Wood which seemed to show that it was waking up and would soon be kicking off the clothes. In the half-light the Pine Trees looked cold and lonely, and the Very Deep Pit seemed deeper than it was, and Pooh's jar of honey at the bottom was something mysterious, a shape and no more. But as he got nearer to it his nose told him that it was indeed honey, and his tongue came out and began to polish up his mouth, ready for it."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,566,"""Bother!"" said Pooh, as he got his nose inside the jar. ""A Heffalump has been eating it!"" And then he thought a little and said, ""Oh, no, I did. I forgot."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,567,"Indeed, he had eaten most of it. But there was a little left at the very bottom of the jar, and he pushed his head right in, and began to lick...¦."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,568,"By and by Piglet woke up. As soon as he woke up he said to himself, ""Oh!"" Then he said bravely, ""Yes,"" and then, still more bravely, ""Quite so."" But he didn't feel very brave at all, for the word which was really jiggeting about in his brain was ""Heffalumps."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,569,What was a Heffalump like?
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,570,Was it fierce?
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,571,Did it come when you whistled? And how did it come?
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,572,Was it Fond of Pigs at all?
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,573,"If it was Fond of Pigs, did it make any difference what sort of Pig?"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,574,"Supposing it was Fierce with Pigs, would it make any difference if the Pig had a grandfather called TRESPASSERS WILLIAM?"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,575,He didn't know the answer to any of these questions...¦ and he was going to see his first Heffalump in about an hour from now!
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,576,"Of course Pooh would be with him, and it was much more Friendly with two. But suppose Heffalumps were Very Fierce with Pigs and Bears? Wouldn't it be better to pretend that he had a headache, and couldn't go up to the Six Pine Trees this morning? But then suppose that it was a very fine day, and there was no Heffalump in the trap, here he would be, in bed all the morning, simply wasting his time for nothing. What should he do?"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,577,"And then he had a Clever Idea. He would go up very quietly to the Six Pine Trees now, peep very cautiously into the Trap, and see if there was a Heffalump there. And if there was, he would go back to bed, and if there wasn't, he wouldn't."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,578,"So off he went. At first he thought that there wouldn't be a Heffalump in the Trap, and then he thought that there would, because he could hear it heffalumping about it like anything."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,579,"""Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!"" said Piglet to himself. And he wanted to run away. But somehow, having got so near, he felt that he must just see what a Heffalump was like. So he crept to the side of the Trap and looked in...¦."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,580,"And all the time Winnie-the-Pooh had been trying to get the honey-jar off his head. The more he shook it, the more tightly it stuck. ""Bother!"" he said inside the jar, and ""Oh, help!"" and, mostly ""Ow!"" And he tried bumping it against things, but as he couldn't see what he was bumping it against, it didn't help him; and he tried to climb out of the Trap, but as he could see nothing but jar, and not much of that, he couldn't find his way. So at last he lifted up his head, jar and all, and made a loud, roaring noise of Sadness and Despair...¦ and it was at that moment that Piglet looked down."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,581,"""Help, help!"" cried Piglet, ""a Heffalump, a Horrible Heffalump!"" and he scampered off as hard as he could, still crying out, ""Help, help, a Herrible Hoffalump! Hoff, Hoff, a Hellible Horralump! Holl, Holl, a Hoffable Hellerump!"" And he didn't stop crying and scampering until he got to Christopher Robin's house."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,582,"""Whatever's the matter, Piglet?"" said Christopher Robin, who was just getting up."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,583,"""Heff,"" said Piglet, breathing so hard that he could hardly speak, ""a Hell- a Heff- a Heffalump."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,584,"""Where?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,585,"""Up there,"" said Piglet, waving his paw."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,586,"""What did it look like?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,587,"""Like- like- It had the biggest head you ever saw, Christopher Robin. A great enormous thing, like- like nothing. A huge big- well, like a- I don't know- like an enormous big nothing. Like a jar."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,588,"""Well,"" said Christopher Robin, putting on his shoes, ""I shall go and look at it. Come on."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,589,"Piglet wasn't afraid if he had Christopher Robin with him, so off they went...¦."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,590,"""I can hear it, can't you?"" said Piglet anxiously, as they got near."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,591,"""I can hear something,"" said Christopher Robin."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,592,It was Pooh bumping his head against a tree-root he had found.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,593,"""There!"" said Piglet. ""Isn't it awful?"" And he held on tight to Christopher Robin' hand."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,594,"Suddenly Christopher Robin began to laugh...¦ and he laughed...¦ and he laughed...¦ and he laughed. And while he was still laughing- Crash went the Heffalump's head against the tree-root, Smash went the jar, and out came Pooh's head again...¦."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,595,"Then Piglet saw what a Foolish Piglet he had been, and he was so ashamed of himself that he ran straight off home and went to bed with a headache. But Christopher Robin and Pooh went home to breakfast together."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,596,"""Oh, Bear!"" said Christopher Robin. ""How I do love you!"""

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1117,"""I am looking, Roo, dear"" said Kanga rather severely. ""And you know what I told you yesterday about making faces.

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1118,"Before he knew where he was, Piglet was in the bath, and Kanga was scrubbing him firmly with a large lathery flannel."

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1129,"Christopher Robin looked at him very carefully, and shook his head. ""You can't be Roo,"" he said, ""because I've just seen Roo playing in Rabbit's house."""

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1131,"""There you are!"" said Piglet. ""I told you so. I'm Piglet."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1132,Christopher Robin shook his head again.
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1133,"""Oh, you're not Piglet,"" he said. ""I know Piglet well, and he's quite a different color."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1134,"Piglet began to say that this was because he had just had a bath, and then he thought that perhaps he wouldn't say that, and as he opened his mouth to say something else, Kanga slipped the medicine spoon in, and then patted him on the back and told him that it was really quite a nice taste when you got used to it."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1135,"""I knew it wasn't Piglet,"" said Kanga.""I wonder who it can be."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1136,"""Perhaps it's some relation of Pooh's"" said Christopher Robin. ""What about a nephew or an uncle or something?"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1137,"Kanga agreed that this was probably what it was, and said that they would have to call it by some name."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1138,"""I shall call it Pootel,"" said Christopher Robin. ""Henry Pootel for short."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1139,"And just when it was decided, Henry Pootel wriggled out of Kanga's arms and jumped to the ground. To his great joy Christopher Robin had left the door open. Never had Henry Pootel Piglet run so fast sa he ran then, and he didn't stop running until he had got quite close to his house. But when he was a hundred yards away he stopped running, and rolled the rest of the way home, so as to het his own nice comfortable colour again...."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1140,"So Kanga and Roo stayed in the Forest. And every Tuesday Roo spent the day with her great friend Pooh, teaching him to jump, and every Tuesday Piglet spent the day with his great friend Christopher Robin. So they were all happy again."

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1143,Christopher Robin Leads an Expotition to the North Pole
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1144,One fine day Pooh had stumped up to the top of the Forest to see if his friend Christopher Robin was interested in Bears at all. At breakfast that morning (a simple meal of marmalade spread lightly over a honeycomb or two) he had suddenly thought of a new song. It began like this:
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1145,"""Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear!"""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1146,"When he had got as far as this, he stretched his head, and thought to himself ""That's a very good start for a song, but what about the second line?"" He tried singing ""Ho,"" two or three times, but it didn't seem to help. ""Perhaps it would be better,"" he thought, ""if I sang Hi for the life of a Bear."" So he sang it ... but it wasn't. ""Very well, then,"" he said, ""I shall sing that first line twice, and perhaps if I sing"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1147," it very quickly, I shall find myself singing the third and fourth lines before I have time to think of them, and that will be a Good Song. Now then:"

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A.

So he turned it into a hum instead."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1159,"Christopher Robin was sitting outside his door, putting on his Big Boots. As soon as he saw the Big"
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1160," Boots, Pooh knew that an Adventure was going to happen, and he brushed the honey off his nose with the back of his paw, and spruced himself up as well as he could, so as to look Ready for Anything."

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1162,"Hallo, Pooh Bear. I can't get this boot on."""

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1167,"""We are all going on an Expedition,"" said Christopher Robin, as he got up and brushed himself. ""Thank you, Pooh."""

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A.

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1649,"""Owl,"" said Christopher Robin, ""I am going to give a party."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1650,"""You are, are you?"" said Owl."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1651,"""And it's to be a special sort of party, because it's because of what Pooh did when he did what he did to save Piglet from the flood."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1652,"""Oh, that's what it's for, is it?"" said Owl."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1653,"""Yes, so will you tell Pooh as quickly as you can, and all the others, because it will be tomorrow."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1654,"""Oh, it will, will it?"" said Owl, still being as helpful as possible."

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1656,"Owl tried to think of something very wise to say, but couldn't, so he flew off to tell the others. And the first person he told was Pooh."

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1659,"Owl felt that it was rather beneath him to talk about little cake things with pink sugar icing, so he told Pooh exactly what Christopher Robin had said, and flew off to Eeyore."

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A.

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1716,"But it didn't rain. Christopher Robin had made a long table out of some long pieces of wood, and they all sat around it. Christopher Robin sat at one end, and Pooh sat at the other, and between them on one side were Owl and Eeyore and Piglet, and between them on the other side were Rabbit, and Roo and Kanga. And all Rabbit's friends-and-relations spread themselves about on the grass, and waited hopefully in case anybody spoke to them, or dropped anything, or asked them the time."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1717,"It was the first party to which Roo had ever been, and he was very excited. As soon as ever they had sat down he began to talk."

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1726,"So Roo, who was drinking his milk, tried to say that he could do both at once...¦ and had to be patted on the back and dried for quite a long time afterwards."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A.

Any of you would have done the same. But it just happened to be Me. It was not, I need hardly say, with an idea of getting what Christopher Robin is looking for now""-and he put his front leg to his mouth and said in a loud whisper, ""Try under the table""-""that I did what I did-but because I feel that we should all do what we can do to help.

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1742,"""Here it is!"" cried Christopher Robin excitedly. ""Pass it down to silly old Pooh. It's for Pooh."""

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1745,"""I might have known,"" said Eeyore. ""After all, one can't complain. I have my friends. Somebody spoke to me only yesterday. And was it last week or the week before that Rabbit bumped into me and said 'Bother!' The Social Round. Always something going on."""
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1746,"Nobody was listening, for they were all saying ""Open it Pooh,"" ""What is it, Pooh?"" ""I know what it is,"" ""No, you don't"" and other helpful remarks of this sort. And of course Pooh was opening it as quickly as ever he could, but without cutting the string, because you never know when a bit of string might be Useful. At last it was undone."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1747,"When Pooh saw what it was, he nearly fell down, he was so pleased. It was a Special Pencil Case. There were pencils in it marked ""B"" for Bear, and pencils marked ""HB"" for Helping Bear, and pencils marked ""BB"" for Brave Bear. There was a knife for sharpening the pencils, and india-rubber for rubbing out anything which you had spelt wrong, and a ruler for ruling lines for the words to walk on, and inches marked on the ruler in case you wanted to know how many inches anything was, and Blue Pencils and Red Pencils and Green Pencils for saying special things in blue and red and green. And all these lovely things were in little pockets of their own in a Special Case which shut with a click when you clicked it. And they were all for Pooh."
L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1748,"""Oh!"" said Pooh."

L195,WINNIE THE POOH,A.A. MILNE,1752,"Later on, when they had all said ""Good-bye"" and ""Thank-you"" to Christopher Robin, Pooh and Piglet walked home thoughtfully together in the golden evening, and for a long time they were silent."

L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,1,"Once upon a time, a long, long time ago, it was the custom"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,2,of all the fathers and mothers in China to give their first and
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,3,honored sons great long names. But second sons were given
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,4,hardly any name at all.
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,5,In a small mountain village there lived a mother who had 
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,6,"two little sons. Her second son she called Chang, which "
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,7,"meant 'little or nothing.' But her first and honored son,"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,8,she called Tikki tikki tembo-no sa rembo-chari bari ruchi-
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,9,"pip peri pembo, which meant 'the most wonderful thing"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,10, in the whole wide world!'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,11,Every morning the mother went to wash in a little stream
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,12,near her home. The two boys always went chattering along
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,13,with her. On the bank was an old well.
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,14,"'Don't go near the well,' warned the mother, 'or you"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,15,will surely fall in.'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,16,They boys did not always mind their mother and one day
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,17,"they were playing beside the well, and on the well when"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,18,Chang fell in.
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,19,Tikki tikki tembo-no sa rembo-chari bari ruchi-pip peri
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,20,pembo ran as fast as his little legs could carry him to his
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,21,"mother and said,"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,22,"'Most Honorable Mother, Chang has fallen into the well!'"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,23,"'The water roars, Little Blossom,' I can not hear you,'"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,24,said the mother.
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,25,Then Tikki tikki tembo-no sa rembo-chari bari ruchi-pip 
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,26,"peri pembo raised his voice and cried, "
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,27,"'Oh, Most Honorable One, Chang has fallen into the well!'"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,28,"'That troublesome boy,' answered the mother. 'Run and "
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,29,get the Old Man With The Ladder to fish him out.'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,30,Then Tikki tikki tembo-no sa rembo-chari bari ruchi-pip 
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,31,peri pembo ran as fast as his little legs could carry him to 
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,32,"the Old Man With The Ladder and said,"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,33,"'Old Man With The Ladder, Chang has fallen into the "
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,34,well. Will you come and fish him out?'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,35,"'So,' said the Old Man With The Ladder, 'Chang has"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,36,fallen into the well.'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,37,And he ran as fast as his old legs could carry him. Step
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,38,"over step, step over step he went into the well, picked up "
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,39,"little Chang, and step over step, step over step brought him"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,40,out of the well.
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,41,He pumped the water out of him and pushed the air
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,42,"into him, and pumped the water out of him and pushed"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,43,"the air into him, and soon Chang was just as good as ever!"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,44,Now for several months the boys did not go near the
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,45,well. But after the Festival of the Eighth Moon they ran to
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,46,the well to eat their rice cakes.
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,47,"They ate near the well, they played around the well,"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,48,they walked on the well and Tikki tikki temb-no sa rembo-
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,49,chari bari ruchi-pip peri pembo fell into the well!
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,50,Chang ran as fast as his little legs could carry him to his
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,51,"mother and said,"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,52,"'Oh, Most Honorable Mother, Tikki tikki temb-no sa "
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,53,rembo-chari bari ruchi-pip peri pembo has fallen into the
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,54,well!'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,55,"'The water roars, Little One,' I cannot hear you,'"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,56,So little Chang took a deep breath.
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,57,"'Oh, Mother, Most Honorable,' he panted, 'Tikki tikki "
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,58,temb-no sa rembo-chari bari ruchi-pip peri pembo has
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,59,fallen into the well!'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,60,"'Tiresome Child, what are you trying to say?' said his"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,61,mother. 
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,62,'Honorable Mother!
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,63,Chari bari

L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,65,"tikki tikki,'"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,66,"he gasped,"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,67,'pip pip
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,68,has fallen into the well!'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,69,"'Unfortunate Son, surely the evil spirits have bewitched"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,70,your tongue. Speak your brother's name with reverence.'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,71,Poor little Chang was all out of breath
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,72,"from saying that great long name, and he"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,73,didn't think he could say it one more
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,74,time. But then he thought of his brother
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,75,in the old well. 
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,76,"Chang bowed his little head clear to the sand, took a "
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,77,"deep breath and slowly said,"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,78,"'Most Honorable Mother, Tikki tikki-tembo-no-sa"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,79,rembo-chari bari-ruchi-pip-peri pembo is at the bottom 
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,80,of the well.'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,81,"'Oh, not my first and honored son, heir of all I possess!"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,82,Run quickly and tell the Old Man With The Ladder that
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,83,Your brother has fallen into the well.'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,84,So Chang ran as fast as his little legs would carry him to 
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,85,the Old Man With The Ladder. Under a tree the Old Man
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,86,With The Ladder sat bowed and silent.
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,87,"'Old Man, Old Man,' shouted Chang. 'Come right"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,88,away! Tikki tikki temb-no sa rembo-chari bari ruchi-pip
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,89,peri pembo has fallen into the stone well!'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,90,But there was no answer. Puzzled he waited. Then with
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,91,"his very last bit of breath he shouted,"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,92,"'Old Man With The Ladder, Tikki tikki temb-no sa "
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,93,rembo-chari bari ruchi-pip peri pembo is at the bottom of
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,94,the well.'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,95,"'Miserable child, you disturb my dream. I had floated"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,96,into a purple mist and found my youth again. There were
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,97,glittering gateways and jeweled blossoms. If I close my eyes
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,98,perhaps I will again return.'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,99,Poor little Chang was frightened. How could he say that
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,100,great long name again?
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,101,"'Please, Old Man With The Ladder, please help my"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,102,brother out of the cold well.'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,103," 'So,' said the Old Man With The Ladder, 'your mother's "
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,104,Precious Pearl' has fallen into the well!'
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,105,The Old Man With The Ladder hurried as fast as his old
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,106,"legs could carry him. Step over step, step over step he went"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,107,"into the well, and step over step, step over step out of the "
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,108,well with the little boy in his arms. Then he pumped the 
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,109,"water out of him and pushed the air into him, and pumped"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,110,the water out of him and pushed the air into him. 
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,111,But little Tikki tikki temb-no sa rembo-chari bari ruchi-
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,112,"pip peri pembo had been in the water so long, all because"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,113,"of his great long name, that the moon rose many times"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,114,before he was quite the same again. 
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,115,And from the day to this the Chinese have always 
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,116,"thought it wise to give all their children little, short names"
L197,TIKKI TIKKI TEMBO,ARLENE MOSEL,117,instead of great long names. 
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,1,One night Mortimer's mother
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,2,took him upstairs to go to bed-

L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,4,When they got upstairs Mortimer's

L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,8,"Mortimer shook his head, yes."
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,9,The mother shut the door.

L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,32,All of Mortimer's seventeen brothers

L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,34,all came up the stairs-
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,35,thump thump thump thump thump thump.
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,36,They opened the door and yelled in a

L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,39,"Mortimer shook his head, yes."
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,40,The brothers and sisters shut the door and

L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,49,They got so upset that they called the
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,50,police. Two policemen came and they
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,51,walked very slowly up the stairs-
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,52,thump thump thump thump thump thump.
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,53,They opened the door and said in very
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,54,"deep, policemen-type voices,"
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,55,"'MORTIMER, BE QUIET.'"
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,56,The policemen shut the door and went

L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,65,"Well, downstairs no one knew what to do."
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,66,The mother got into a big fight with the
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,67,policemen.
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,68,The father got into a big fight with the
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,69,brothers and sisters.
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,70,"Upstairs, Mortimer got so tired waiting for"
L198,MORTIMER,ROBERT MUNSCH,71,someone to come up that he fell asleep.
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,1,There once was a boy named Nikolai who sometimes felt
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,2,"uncertain about the right way to act. 'I want to be a good person,' he told his"
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,3,friends. 'But I don't always know the best way to do that.'
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,4,Nikolai's friends understood and they wanted to help him.
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,5,"If only I could find the answers to my three questions,' Nikolai continued,"
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,6,'Then I would always know what to do.'

L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,8,Who is the most important one?
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,9,What is the right thing to do?
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,10,Nikolai's friends considered
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,11,his first question.
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,12,"Then Sonya, the heron,"
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,13,spoke. 'To know the best time
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,14,"to do things, one must plan in"

L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,18,leaves to find something good
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,19,"to eat, said, 'You will know"
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,20,when to do things if you watch
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,21,and pay close attention.'
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,22,"Then Pushkin, the dog, who"
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,23,"was just dozing off, rolled over"
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,24,"and said, 'You can't pay"
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,25,attention to everything yourself.
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,26,You need a pack to keep watch
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,27,and help you decide when to do

L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,31,Nikolai thought for a moment. Then he 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,32,asked his second question. 'Who is the
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,33,most important one?'
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,34,'Those who are closest to
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,35,"heaven,' said Sonya, circling up"
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,36,into the sky.' 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,37,'Those who knew how to
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,38,"heal the sick,' said Gogol,"
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,39,stroking his bruised noggin.
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,40,"'Those who make the rules,'"
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,41,growled Pushkin.
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,42, Nikolai thought some more. Then he asked the
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,43,third question. 'What is the right thing to do?'
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,44,"'Flying,' said Sonya."
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,45,"'Having fun all the time,' laughed Gogol."
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,46,"'Fighting,' barked Pushkin right away."
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,47,Then the boy thought for a long while. He loved his friends.
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,48,He knew they were all trying their best to help him answer his
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,49,questions. But their answers didn't seem quite rights.
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,50,"Then, an idea came to him. I know! He thought. I will ask"
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,51,"Leo, the turtle. He has lived a very long time. Surely he will know "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,52,the answers I am looking for.
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,53,Nikolai hiked up high into the mountain where the old turtle lived all alone. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,54,"When Nikolai arrived, he found Leo digging a garden. The turtle was old and the digging was hard for him. 'I have three questions and I came to ask for your help,' Nikolai said."
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,55,'When is the best time to do things? Who is the most important one? What is the right thing to do?'
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,56,"Leo listened carefully, but he only smiled."
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,57,Then he went on with his digging.
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,58,"'You must be tired,' Nikolai said at last. 'Let me help you.' The turtle gave him his shovel and thanked him. "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,59,And because it was easier for a young boy to dig than it was for and old
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,60,"Turtle, Nikolai kept on digging until the rows were finished. "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,61,"But just as they finished, the wind blew wildly "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,62,and rain burst from the darkened clouds. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,63,"As they moved towards the cottage for shelter, "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,64,Nikolai suddenly heard a cry for help. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,65,Running down the path he found a panda whose leg had 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,66,been injured by a falling tree. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,67,Carefully Nikolai carried her into Leo's house and made a 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,68,splint for her leg with a stick of bamboo. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,69,The storm raged on banging at the doors and windows. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,70,The Panda woke up. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,71,"'Where am I,' she said, 'and where is my child?' "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,72,The boy ran out of the cottage and down the path. The roar of the 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,73,storm was deafening. Pushing around by the howling wind and drenching rain he ran farther into the forest. There he found the panda's child cold 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,74,and shivering on the ground. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,75,"The little panda was wet and scared, but alive. Nikolai carried her inside "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,76,and made her warm and dry. Then he laid her in her mothers' arms. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,77,Leo smiled when he saw what the boy had done. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,78,"The next morning, the sun was warm, birds "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,79,"sang, and all was well with the world, The "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,80,"panda's leg was healing nicely, and she "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,81,thanked Nikolai for saving her baby 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,82,from the storm.
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,83,"At that moment, Sonya, Gogol and Pushkin "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,84,arrived to make sure everyone was alright. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,85,Nikolai felt great peace within himself. He had wonderful
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,86,friends. And he had saved the panda and her child. But he
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,87,also felt disappointed. He still had not found the answers 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,88,to his three questions. So he asked Leo one more time.
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,89,"The old turtle looked at the boy, "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,90,"'But your questions have been answered,' he said."
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,91,'They have?' asked the boy. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,92,"'Yesterday if you had not stayed to help me dig my garden you wouldn't have heard the panda's cries for help in the storm. Therefore, the most important time was the time you spend digging the garden. The most important one at that moment was me, and the most important thing to do was to help me with my garden. "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,93,"Later when you found the injured panda, the most important time was "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,94,the time you spent mending her leg and saving her child. The most important ones were the panda and her baby. The most important thing 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,95,to do was to take care of them and make them safe. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,96,Remember then that there is only one important time and that time is now. The most important on is always the one you are with. At the most important 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,97,"thing to do is for the one who is standing at your side. For these, my dear"
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,98,"boy, are the answers to what is most important in this world."
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,99,'This is why we are here.'
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,100,[[Author's Note
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,101,"Many years ago, I found the three questions mentioned in a book by Thich Nhat Hanh, A Vietnamese Zen Master. When I first read the story, it was if a golden bell in me had struck reminding me that I already knew this tale by heart. Some books are like that and it has happened for me very often with the writer Leo Tolstoy."
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,102," The original short story is not about a boy with animal friends, but a Czar who is looking for answers to three questions. His adventure was of a different kind. Rather than saving a panda and her child, he unwittingly rescues someone who is trying to harm him. By saving his enemy, he creates a profound connection with another human being. I encourage those readers interesting in sophisticated layers of intrigue to out Leo Tolstoy's original story of the same name. "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,103,"I wanted to tell this story to a young audience, "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,104,So its form here is somewhat different than Tolstoy's. I hope he would be honored by this telling. I hope it would make him smile. 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,105,"The animal characters borrow their names from many places. Pushkin and Gogol are the names of the famous Russian writers. Sonya was the name of Leo Tolstoy's wife. Nikolai was the name of Leo Tolstoy's brother, and also my son who modeled for the character. Pushkin was modeled for by my dog, Raymond. My daughter Adelaine is the baby panda. And the character Leo is, of course, Tolstoy. "
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,106,Count Leo Tolstoy (1828-1920) Was one of Russia's greatest novelists and 
L199,THE THREE QUESTIONS,JOHN J. MUTH,107,"one of its most influential moral philosophers and social reformers. He is renowned as the author of War and Peace (1865-1869) and Anna Karenina (1875-1877) and also is an outstanding thinker of the 19th century. His short story, 'The Three Questions,' on which this book is based, was published in 1903.]]"

L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,8,with Mr. Rogers.
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,9,They drove away.

L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,15,These must be rich folks.

L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,25,"I do make good pies."""
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,26,So Amelia Bedelia went
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,27,into the kitchen.
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,28,She put a little of this
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,29,and a pinch of that 
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,30,into a bowl.
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,31,She mixed and she rolled.
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,32,Soon her pie was ready

L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,34,"""There,"" said Amelia Bedelia."

L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,43,"Why change them?"" she thought."
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,44,Then Amelia Bedelia remembered
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,45,What Mrs. Rogers had said.
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,46,She must do just what 
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,47,the list told her.
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,48,"""Well, all right,"""
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,49,said Amelia Bedelia.

L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,61,Amelia Bedelia took
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,62,one last look at the bathroom.
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,63,She saw a big box with the words
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,64,Dusting Powder on it...

L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,83,"but I'll try."""
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,84,So Amelia Bedelia sat right down

L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,86,Amelia Bedelia
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,87,marked off

L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,97,And Amelia Bedelia

L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,106,She took the pie out of the oven
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,107,and put it on the table to cool.
L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,108,Then she looked at the list.

L201,AMELIA BEDELIA,PEGGY PARISH,118,Then she poured the rice

M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,31,"George sat on a little stool and the man said,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,32,"'George, I am going to take you to a big Zoo"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,33,in a big city. You will like it there.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,34,"Now run along and play,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,35,but don't get into trouble.'
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,36,George promised to be good.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,37,But it is easy for little monkeys to forget.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,38,On the deck he found some sea gulls.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,39,He wondered how they could fly. 
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,40,He was very curious.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,41,Finally he HAD to try.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,42,It looked easy. But-
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,43,"oh, what happened!"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,44,First this-
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,45,and then this!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,46,'WHERE IS GEORGE?'
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,47,The sailors looked and looked.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,48,At last they saw him
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,49,"struggling in the water,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,50,and almost all tired out.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,51,'Man overboard!' the sailors cried
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,52,as they threw him a lifebelt.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,53,George caught it and held on.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,54,At last he was safe on board.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,55,After that George was more careful
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,56,"to be a good monkey, until at last,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,57,the long trip was over.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,58,"George said good-bye to the kind sailors,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,59,and he and the man with the yellow hat
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,60,walked off the ship on to the store
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,61,and on into the city to the man's house. 
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,62,After a good meal
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,63,and a good pipe
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,64,George felt very tired.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,65,He crawled into bed
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,66,and fell asleep at once.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,67,The next morning
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,68,the man telephoned the Zoo.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,69,George watched him.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,70,He was fascinated.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,71,Then the man went away.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,72,George was curious.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,73,"He wanted to telephone, too."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,74,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,75,What fun!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,76,DING-A-LING-A-LING!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,77,GEORGE HAD TELEPHONED
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,78,THE FIRE STATION!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,79,The fireman rushed to the telephone.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,80,'Hello! Hello!' they said.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,81,But there was no answer.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,82,Then they looked for the signal
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,83,on the big map that showed
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,84,where the telephone call had come from.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,85,They didn't know it was GEORGE.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,86,They thought it was a real fire.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,87,HURRY! HURRY! HURRY!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,88,The firemen jumped on to the fire engines
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,89,and on to the hook-and-ladders.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,90,Ding-dong-ding-dong.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,91,Everyone out of the way!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,92,Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,93,The firemen rushed into the house.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,94,They opend the door.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,95,NO FIRE!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,96,ONLY a naughty little monkey.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,97,"'Oh, catch him, catch him,' they cried."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,98,George tried to run away.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,99,"He almost did, but he got caught"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,100,"in the telephone wire, and-"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,101,a thin fireman caught one arm
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,102,and a fat fireman caught the other.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,103,"'You fooled the fire department,'"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,104,they said. 'We will have to shut you up
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,105,where you can't do any more harm.'
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,106,They took him away
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,107,and shut him in a prison.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,108,George wanted to get out.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,109,He climbed up to the window
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,110,to try the bars.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,111,Just then the watchman came in.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,112,He got on the wooden bed to catch George.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,113,But he was too big and heavy.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,114,"The bed tipped up,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,115,"the watchman fell over,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,116,"and, quick as lightning,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,117,George ran out through the open door.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,118,He hurried through the building
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,119,and out on to the roof. And then
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,120,he was lucky to be a monkey:
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,121,out he walked on to the telephone wires.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,122,"Quickly and quietly over the guard's head,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,123,George walked away.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,124,He was free!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,125,Down in the street
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,126,"outside the prison wall,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,127,stood a balloon man.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,128,A little girl bought a balloon
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,129,for her brother.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,130,George watched.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,131,He was curious again.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,132,He felt he MUST have
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,133,a bright red balloon.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,134,He reached over and
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,135,"tried to help himself, but-"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,136,"instead of one balloon,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,137,the whole bunch broke loose.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,138,In an instant
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,139,the wind whisked them all away
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,140,"and, with them, went George,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,141,holding tight with both hands.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,142,"Up, up he sailed, higher and higher."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,143,The houses looked like toy houses
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,144,"and the people like dolls,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,145,George was frightened.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,146,He held on very tight.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,147,At first the wind blew in great gusts.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,148,Then it quieted.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,149,Finally it stopped blowing altogether.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,150,George was very tired.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,151,"Down, down he went-bump,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,152,on to the top of a traffic light.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,153,Everyone was surprised.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,154,The traffic got all mixed up.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,155,"George didn't know what to do,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,156,"and then he heard someone call,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,157,'GEORGE!' 
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,158,"He looked down and saw his friend,"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,159,the man with the big yellow hat!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,160,George was very happy.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,161,The man was happy too.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,162,George slid down the post
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,163,and the man with the big yellow hat
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,164,put him under his arm.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,165,Then he paid the balloon man
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,166,for all the balloons.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,167,And then George and the man
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,168,climbed into the car
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,169,"and at last, away they went"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,170,to the ZOO!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,171,What a nice place
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,172,for George to live!

L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,1,My grandfather was a young man when he left his home in Japan 
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,2,and went to see the world.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,3,He wore European clothes for the first time and began his journey 
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,4,on a steamship. The Pacific Ocean astonished him.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,5,For three weeks he did not see land. When land finally appeared 
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,6,it was the New World.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,7,"He explored North America by train and riverboat, and often walked "
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,8,for days on end.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,9,Deserts with rocks like enormous sculptures amazed him.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,10,The endless farm field reminded him of the ocean he had crossed.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,11,Huge cities of factories and tall buildings bewildered and yet excited him
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,12,He marveled at the towering mountains and rivers as clear as the sky.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,13,He met many people along the way. He shook hands with black men 
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,14,"and white men, with yellow men and red men."
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,15,"The more he traveled, the more he longed to see new places, and never "
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,16,thought of returning home.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,17,"Of all the places he visited, he liked California best. He loved the "
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,18,"strong sunlight there, the Sierra Mountains, the lonely seacoast."
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,19,"After a time, he returned to his village in Japan to marry his childhood"
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,20,sweetheart. Then he brought his bride to the new country.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,21,They made their home by the San Francisco Bay and had a baby girl.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,22,"As his daughter grew, my grandfather began to think about his own childhood. "
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,23,He thought about his old friends.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,24,He remembered the mountains and rivers of his home. He surrounded 
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,25,"himself with songbirds, but he could not forget."
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,26,"Finally, when his daughter was nearly grown, he could wait no more. "
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,27,He took his family and returned to his homeland.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,28,Once again he saw the mountains and rivers of his childhood. 
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,29,They were just as he had remembered them.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,30,Once again he exchanged stories and laughed with his old friends.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,31,But the village was not a place for a daughter from San Francisco. 
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,32,So my grandfather bought a house in a large city nearby.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,33,"There, the young woman fell in love, married, and sometime later I was born."
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,34,"When I was a small boy, my favorite weekend was a visit to my "
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,35,grandfather's house. He told me many stories about California.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,36,"He raised warblers and silvereyes, but he could not forget the mountains "
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,37,And rivers of California. So he planned a trip.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,38,But a war began. Bombs fell from the sky and scattered our lives 
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,39,like leaves in a storm.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,40,"When the war ended, there was nothing left of the city and of the house "
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,41,where my grandparents had lived.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,42,So they returned to the village where they had been children. 
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,43,But my grandfather never kept another songbird.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,44,"The last time I saw him, my grandfather said that he longed to see California "
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,45,One more time. He never did.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,46,"And when I was nearly grown, I left home and went to see California"
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,47,for myself.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,48,"After a time, I came to love the land my grandfather had loved, "
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,49,and I stayed on and on until I had a daughter of my own.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,50,But I also miss the mountains and rivers of my childhood. 
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,51,"I miss my old friends. So I return now and then, when I can not still "
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,52,the longing in my heart.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,53,"The funny thing is, the moment I am in one country, "
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,54,I am homesick for the other.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,55,I think I know my grandfather now. 
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,56,I miss him very much.
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,57,[[Through the compelling reminiscences of
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,58,his grandfather's life in America and 
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,59,"Japan, Allen Say delivers a poignant"
L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,60,account of his family's unique cross-

L217,GRANDFATHER'S JOURNEY,ALLEN SAY,63,and describes the strong and constant

L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,8,"[[A long time ago, people used to tell magical stories of wonder and enchantment. Those stories were called Fairy Tales. Those stories are not in this book. The stories in this book are almost Fairy Tales. But not quite. The stories in this book are Fairly Stupid Tales. I mean, what else would you call a story like ""Goldilocks and the Three Elephants""? This girl walking through the woods smells Peanut Porridge cooking. She decides to break into the Elephants' house, eat the porridge, sit in the chairs, and sleep in the beds. But when she gets in the house she can't climb up on Baby Elephant's chair because it's too big. She can't climb up on Mama Elephant's chair because it's much too big. And she can't climb up on Papa Elephant's chair because it's much much too big. So she goes home. The End."
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,9,"And if you don't think that's fairly stupid, you should read ""Little Red Running Shorts"" or maybe ""The Stinky Cheese Man."" In fact, you should definitely go read the stories now, because the rest of this introduction just kind of goes on and on and doesn't really say anything. I stuck it on to the end here so it would fill up the page and make it look like I really knew what I was talking about. So stop now. I mean it. Quit reading. Turn the page. If you read this last sentence, it won't tell you anything.]]"

L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,28,The sky wasn't falling.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,29,The Table of Contents was. It fell and squashed everybody. The End.

L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,31,Once upon a time there was a Prince. And this Prince's dad and mom (the King and Queen) somehow got it into their royal heads that no Princess would be good enough for their boy unless she could feel a pea through one hundred mattresses.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,32,"So it should come as no surprise that the Prince had a very hard time finding a Princess. Every time he met a nice girl, his mom and dad would pile one hundred mattresses on top of a pea and then invite her to sleep over."
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,33,"When the Princess came down for breakfast, the Queen would ask, ""How did you sleep, dear?"""
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,34,"The Princess would politely say, ""Fine, thank you."""
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,35,And the King would show her the door.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,36,"Now this went on for three years. And of course nobody ever felt the pea under one hundred mattresses. Then one day the Prince met the girl of his dreams. He decided he better do something about it. That night, before the Princess went to bed, the Prince slipped his bowling ball under the one hundred mattresses."
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,37,"When the Princess came down for breakfast the next morning, the Queen asked, ""How did you sleep, dear?"""
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,38,"""This might sound odd,"" said the Princess. ""But I think you need another mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a lump as big as a bowling ball."""
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,39,The King and Queen were satisfied.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,40,The Prince and Princess were married.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,41,"And everyone lived happily, though maybe not completely honestly, ever after. The End."

L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,43,Once upon a time there was a mother duck and a father duck who had seven baby ducklings. Six of them were regular-looking ducklings. The seventh was a really ugly duckling.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,44,"Everyone used to say, ""What a nice-looking bunch of ducklings - all except that one. Boy, he's really ugly."""
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,45,"The really ugly duckling heard these people, but he didn't care. He knew that one day he would probably grow up to be a swan and be bigger and look better than anything in the pond."
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,46,"Well, as it turned out, he was just a really ugly duckling. And he grew up to be just a really ugly duck. The End."
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,47,"""I planted the wheat. I watered the wheat. I harvested the wheat. Now do I get to tell my story?"" said the Little Red Hen. ""Say, what's going on here? Why is that page blank? Is that my page? Where is that lazy dog? Where is that lazy cat? Where is that lazy mouse?

Now this is the good part because Red runs so fast that she beats the wolf to granny's house. He knocks on the door. Red answers it. And guess what she says? 'My, what slow feet you have.'

L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,107,It just took him longer than most people.

L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,118,Once upon a time there was a little old woman and a little old man who lived together in a little old house. They were lonely. So the little old lady decided to make a man out of stinky cheese. She gave him a piece of bacon for a mouth and two olives for eyes and put him in the oven to cook.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,119,"When she opened the oven to see if he was done, the smell knocked her back."
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,120,"""Phew! What is that terrible smell?"" she cried. The Stinky Cheese Man hopped out of the oven and ran out the door calling, ""Run run run as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the Stinky Cheese Man!"""
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,121,The little old lady and the little old man sniffed the air.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,122,"""I'm not really very hungry,"" said the little old man."
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,123,"""I'm not really all that lonely,"" said the little old lady. So they didn't chase the Stinky Cheese Man. The Stinky Cheese Man ran and ran until he met a cow eating grass in a field. ""Wow! What's that awful smell?"" said the cow."
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,124,"The Stinky Cheese Man said, ""I've run away from a little old lady and a little old man and I can run away from you too I can. Run run run as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the Stinky Cheese Man!"""

L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,126,So the cow didn't chase the stinky cheese man either.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,127,The Stinky Cheese Man ran and ran until he met some kids playing outside school.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,128,"""Gross,"" said a little girl. ""What's that nasty smell?"""

L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,131,So the kids didn't chase the Stinky Cheese Man either.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,132,By and by the Stinky Cheese Man came to a river with no bridge.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,133,"""How will I ever cross this river? It's too big to jump, and if I try to swim across I'll probably fall apart,"" said You-Know-Who."
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,134,Just then the sly fox (who shows up in a lot of stories like these) poked his head out of the bushes.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,135,"""Why, just hop on my back and I'll carry you across, Stinky Cheese Man."""

L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,138,So the Stinky Cheese Man hopped on the fox's back.
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,139,"The fox swam to the middle of the river and said, ""Oh man! What is that funky smell?"""
L222,THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES,JON SCIESZKA,140,"The fox coughed, gagged, and sneezed, and the Stinky Cheese Man flew off his back and into the river where he fell apart. The End."

L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,144,We took a look.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,145,We saw a Nook.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,146,On his head
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,147,he had a hook.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,148,On his hook
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,149,he had a book.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,150,On his book
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,151,was 'How to Cook.'
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,152,We saw him sit
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,153,and try to cook.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,154,He took a look
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,155,at the book on the hook.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,156,"But a Nook can't read,"
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,157,so a Nook can't cook.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,158,SO...
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,159,what good to a Nook
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,160,is a hook cook book?
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,161,The moon was out
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,162,and we saw some sheep.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,163,We saw some sheep
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,164,take a walk in their sleep.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,165,"By the light of the moon,"

L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,169,I would never walk.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,170,I would take a car.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,171,I do not like
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,172,this one so well.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,173,All he does
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,174,"is yell, yell, yell."
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,175,I will not have this one about.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,176,When he comes in
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,177,I put him out.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,178,This one is
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,179,quiet as a mouse.
L231,ONE FISH TWO FISH RED FISH BLUE FISH,DR. SEUSS,180,I like to have him

L233,THERE'S A WOCKET IN MY POCKET!,DR. SEUSS,34,...I think.
L233,THERE'S A WOCKET IN MY POCKET!,DR. SEUSS,35,Some of them

L233,THERE'S A WOCKET IN MY POCKET!,DR. SEUSS,37,Like the

L233,THERE'S A WOCKET IN MY POCKET!,DR. SEUSS,77,I don't like him.
L233,THERE'S A WOCKET IN MY POCKET!,DR. SEUSS,78,Not at all.
L233,THERE'S A WOCKET IN MY POCKET!,DR. SEUSS,79,And it makes me sort of nervous 
L233,THERE'S A WOCKET IN MY POCKET!,DR. SEUSS,80,when the ZALL scoots down the HALL.

L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,1,"On the far-away island of Sala-ma-Sond,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,2,Yertle the Turtle was king of the pond.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,3,A nice little pond.  It was clean.  It was neat.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,4,The water was warm.  There was plenty to eat.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,5,The turtles had everything turtles might need.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,6,And they were all happy.  Quite happy indeed.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,7,"They were... until Yertle, the king of them all,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,8,Decided the kingdom he ruled was too small.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,9,"""I'm ruler"", said Yertle, ""of all that I see."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,10,But I don't see enough.  That's the trouble with me.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,11,"With this stone for a throne, I look down on my pond"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,12,But I cannot look down on the places beyond.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,13,"This throne that I sit on is too, too low down."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,14,"It ought to be higher!"" he said with a frown."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,15,"""If I could sit high, how much greater I'd be!"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,16,"What a king! I'd be ruler of all that I see!"""
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,17,"So Yertle, the Turtle King, lifted his hand"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,18,"And Yertle, the Turtle King, gave a command."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,19,He ordered nine turtles to swim to his stone
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,20,"And, using these turtles, he built a new throne."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,21,He made each turtle stand on another one's back
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,22,And he piled them all up in a nine-turtle stack.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,23,And then Yertle climbed up.  He sat down on the pile.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,24,What a wonderful view! He could see 'most a mile!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,25,"""All mine!"" Yertle cried.  ""Oh, the things I now rule!"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,26,I'm king of a cow! And I'm king of a mule!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,27,"I'm king of a house! And, what's more, beyond that"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,28,I'm king of a blueberry bush and a cat!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,29,"I'm Yertle the Turtle! Oh, marvelous me!"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,30,"For I am the ruler of all that I see!"""
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,31,"And all through that morning, he sat there up high"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,32,"Saying over and over, ""A great king am I!"""
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,33,Until 'long about noon.  Then he heard a faint sigh.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,34,"""What's that?"" snapped the king"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,35,And he looked down the stack.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,36,"And he saw, at the bottom, a turtle named Mack."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,37,Just a part of his throne.  And this plain little turtle
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,38,"Looked up and he said, ""Beg your pardon, King Yertle."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,39,"""I've pains in my back and my shoulders and knees."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,40,"How long must we stand here, Your Majesty, please?"""
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,41,"""SILENCE!"" the King of the Turtles barked back."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,42,"""I'm king, and you're only a turtle named Mack."""
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,43,"""You stay in your place while I sit here and rule."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,44,I'm king of a cow! And I'm king of a mule!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,45,I'm king of a house! And a bush! And a cat!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,46,But that isn't all.  I'll do better than that!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,47,"My throne shall be higher!"" his royal voice thundered,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,48,"""So pile up more turtles! I want 'bout two hundred!"""
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,49,"""Turtles! More turtles!"" he bellowed and brayed."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,50,And the turtles 'way down in the pond were afraid.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,51,They trembled.  They shook.  But they came.  They obeyed.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,52,"From all over the pond, they came swimming by dozens."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,53,"Whole families of turtles, with uncles and cousins."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,54,And all of them stepped on the head of poor Mack.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,55,"One after another, they climbed up the stack."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,56,"THEN Yertle the Turtle was perched up so high,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,57,He could see forty miles from his throne in the sky!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,58,"""Hooray!"" shouted Yertle.  ""I'm king of the trees!"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,59,I'm king of the birds! And I'm king of the bees!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,60,I'm king of the butterflies! King of the air!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,61,"Ah, me! What a throne! What a wonderful chair!"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,62,"I'm Yertle the Turtle! Oh, marvelous me!"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,63,"For I am the ruler of all that I see!"""
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,64,"Then again, from below, in the great heavy stack,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,65,Came a groan from that plain little turtle named Mack.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,66,"""Your Majesty, please... I don't like to complain,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,67,"But down here below, we are feeling great pain."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,68,"I know, up on top you are seeing great sights,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,69,"But down here at the bottom we, too, should have rights."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,70,We turtles can't stand it.  Our shells will all crack!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,71,"Besides, we need food.  We are starving!"" groaned Mack."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,72,"""You hush up your mouth!"" howled the mighty King Yertle."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,73,"""You've no right to talk to the world's highest turtle."
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,74,I rule from the clouds! Over land! Over sea!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,75,"There's nothing, no, NOTHING, that's higher than me!"""
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,76,"But, while he was shouting, he saw with sur  prise"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,77,That the moon of the evening was starting to rise
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,78,Up over his head in the darkening skies.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,79,"""What's THAT?"" snorted Yertle.  ""Say, what IS that thing"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,80,That dares to be higher than Yertle the King?
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,81,I shall not allow it! I'll go higher still!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,82,I'll build my throne higher! I can and I will!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,83,I'll call some more turtles.  I'll stack 'em to heaven!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,84,"I need 'bout five thousand, six hundred and seven!"""
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,85,"But, as Yertle, the Turtle King, lifted his hand"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,86,"And started to order and give the command,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,87,"That plain little turtle below in the stack,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,88,"That plain little turtle whose name was just Mack,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,89,Decided he'd taken enough.  And he had.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,90,And that plain little lad got a bit mad
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,91,And that plain little Mack did a plain little thing.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,92,He burped!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,93,And his burp shook the throne of the king!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,94,[[BURP!]]
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,95,"And Yertle the Turtle, the king of the trees,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,96,"The king of the air and the birds and the bees,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,97,The king of a house and a cow and a mule...
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,98,"Well, that was the end of the Turtle King's rule!"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,99,"For Yertle, the King of all Sala-ma-Sond,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,100,Fell off his high throne and fell Plunk! in the pond!
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,101,"And today the great Yertle, that Marvelous he,"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,102,Is King of the Mud.  That is all he can see.
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,103,"And the turtles, of course... all the turtles are free"
L234,YERTLE THE TURTLE,DR. SEUSS,104,"As turtles and, maybe, all creatures should be."

L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,208,And his bottom grew into his chair.
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,209,"And his chin turned into a tuning dial,"
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,210,And antennae grew out of his hair.
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,211,"And his brains turned into TV tubes,"
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,212,And his face to a TV screen.
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,213,"And two knobs saying ""VERT."" and ""HORIZ."""
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,214,Grew where his ears had been.

L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,217,And now instead of him watching TV

L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,338,"And I only come up to his toe, you know,"

L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,340,When the daylight grows dim I talk with him
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,341,"Way down in the marshy sands,"
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,342,"And his ear is too far away to hear,"

L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,370,I opened my eyes
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,371,"And looked up at the rain,"

L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,382,TWO BOXES
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,383,Two boxes met upon the road.
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,384,"Said one unto the other, ""If you're a box,"

L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,390,"And so two boxes, hand in hand,"
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,391,Went home to have their dinner.
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,392,TRUE STORY
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,393,This morning I jumped on my horse
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,394,"And went out for a ride,"
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,395,And some wild outlaws chased me
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,396,And they shot me in the side.
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,397,So I crawled into a wildcat's cave
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,398,"To find a place to hide,"
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,399,"But some pirates found me sleeping there,"
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,400,And soon they had me tied
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,401,To a pole and built a fire
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,402,Under me - I almost cried
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,403,Till a mermaid came and cut me loose
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,404,"And begged to be my bride,"
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,405,So I said I'd come back Wednesday
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,406,But I must admit I lied.
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,407,Then I ran into a jungle swamp
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,408,But I forgot my guide
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,409,"And I stepped into some quicksand,"
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,410,And no matter how I tried

L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,412,"A water snake named Clyde,"

L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,415,But an eagle came and swooped me up
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,416,"And through the air we flied,"
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,417,But he dropped me in a boiling lake
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,418,A thousand miles wide.
L236,WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,419,And you'll never guess what I did then -

L237,LITTLE OWL'S NIGHT,DIVYA SRINIVASAN,10,"On the way, Little Owl flew by Grumbly Cave. Bear was inside, snoring up a storm."

L237,LITTLE OWL'S NIGHT,DIVYA SRINIVASAN,12,"But the bear kept snoring, as usual. Little Owl flew home to his tree, gazing at the sky."

L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,1,"Mrs. Bobbin, the dressmaker, was tired and had a bad headache, but she still managed to sew the last stitches in the gown she was making."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,2,"'It's the most beautiful dress in the whole world!' said her daughter, Irene. 'The duchess will love it.'"
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,3,"'It is nice,' her mother admitted. 'But, dumpling, it's for tonight's ball, and I don't have the strength to bring it. I feel sick.' "
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,4,"'Poor Mama,' said Irene. 'I can get it there!'"
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,5,"'No, cupcake, I can't let you,' said Mrs. Bobbin. 'Such a huge package, and it's such a long way to the palace. Besides, it's starting to snow."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,6,"'But I love snow,' Irene insisted. She coaxed her mother into bed, covered her with two quilts, and added a blanket for her feet. Then she fixed her some tea with lemon and honey and put more wood in the stove."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,7,"With great care, Irene took the splendid gown down from the dummy and packed it in a big box with plenty of tissue paper."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,8,"'Dress warmly, pudding,' her mother called in a weak voice, 'and don't forget to button up. It's cold out there, and windy.'"
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,9,"Irene put on her fleece-lined boots, her red hat and muffler, her heavy coat, and her mittens. She kissed her mother's hot forehead six times, then once again, made sure she was tucked in snugly, and slipped out with the big box, shutting the door firmly behind her."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,10,"It really was cold outside, very cold. The wind whirled the falling snowflakes about, this way, that way, and into Irene's squinting face. She set out on the uphill path to Farmer Bennett's sheep pasture."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,11,"By the time she got there, the snow was up to her ankles and the wind was worse. It hurried her along and made her stumble. Irene resented this; the box was problem enough. 'Easy does it!' she cautioned the wind, leaning back hard against it."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,12,"By the middle of the pasture, the flakes were falling thicker. Now the wind drove Irene along so rudely she had to hop, skip, and go helter-skeltering over the knobby ground. Cold snow sifted into her boots and chilled her feet. She pushed out her lip and hurried on. This was an important errand."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,13,"When she reached Apple Road, the wind decided to put on a show. It ripped branches from trees and flung them about, swept up and scattered the fallen snow, got in front of Irene to keep her from moving ahead. Irene turned around and pressed on backwards."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,14,'Go home!' the wind squalled. 'Irene . . . go hooooooome. . .'
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,15,"'I will do no such thing,' she snapped. 'No such thing, you wicked wind!'"
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,16,"'Go ho-o-ome,' the wind yodeled. 'GO HO-WO-WOME,' it shrieked, 'or else.' For a short second, Irene wondered if she shouldn't heed the wind's warning. But no! The gown had to get to the duchess!"
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,17,"The wind wrestled her for the package - walloped it, twisted it, shook it, snatched at it. But Irene wouldn't yield. 'It's my mother's work!' she screamed."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,18,"Then - oh, woe! - the box was wrenched from her mittened grasp and send bumbling along in the snow. Irene went after it."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,19,"She pounced and took hold, but the ill-tempered wind ripped the box open. The ball gown flounced out and went waltzing through the powdered air with tissue-paper attendants."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,20,Irene clung to the empty box and watched the beautiful gown disappear.
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,21,"How could anything so terribly wrong be allowed to happen? Tears froze on her lashes. Her dear mother's hard work, all those days of measuring, cutting, pinning, stitching . . . for this? And the poor duchess! Irene decided she would have to trudge on with just the box and explain everything in person."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,22,"She went shuffling through the snow. Would her mother understand, she wondered, that it was the wind's fault, not hers? Would the duchess be angry? The wind was howling like a wild animal."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,23,Suddenly Irene stepped in a hole and fell over with a twisted ankle. She blamed it on the wind. 'Keep quiet!' she scolded. 'You've done enough damage already. You've spoiled everything! Everything!' The wind swallowed up her words.
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,24,"She sat in the snow in great pain, afraid she wouldn't be able to go on. But she managed to get to her feet and start moving. It hurt. Home, where she longed to be, where she and her mother could be warm together, was far behind. It's got to be closer to the palace, she thought. But where any place was in all this snow, she couldn't be sure."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,25,"She plowed on, dragging furrows with her sore foot. The short winter day was almost done."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,26,"Am I still going the right way, she wondered. There was no one around to advise her. Whoever else there was in this snow-covered world was far, far away, and safe indoors - even the animals in their burrows. She went plodding on."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,27,Soon night took over. She knew in the dark that the muffled snow was still falling - she could feel it. She was cold and alone in the middle of nowhere. Irene was lost.
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,28,"She had to keep moving. She was hoping she'd come to a house, any house at all, and be taken in. She badly needed to be in someone's arms. The snow was above her knees now. She shoved her way through it, clutching the empty box."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,29,"She was asking how long a small person could keep this struggle up, when she realized it was getting lighter. There was a soft glow coming from somewhere below her."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,30,"She waded toward this glow, and soon was gazing down a long slope at a brightly lit mansion. It had to be the palace!"
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,31,Irene pushed forward with all her strength and - sloosh! thwump! - she plunged downward and was buried. She had fallen off a little cliff. Only her hat and the box in her hands stuck out above the snow.
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,32,"Even if she could call for help, no one would hear her. Her body shook. Her teeth chattered. Why not freeze to death, she thought, and let all these troubles end. Why not? She was already buried."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,33,"And never see her mother's face again? Her good mother who smelled like fresh-baked bread? In an explosion of fury, she flung her body about to free herself and was finally able to climb up on her knees and look around."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,34,"How to get down to that glittering palace? As soon as she raised the question, she had the answer."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,35,"She laid the box down and climbed aboard. But it pressed into the snow and stuck. She tried again, and this time, instead of climbing on, she leaped. The box shot forward, like a sled."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,36,"The wind raced after Irene but couldn't keep up. In a moment she would be with people again, inside where it was warm. The sled slowed and jerked to a stop on paving stones."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,37,"The time had come to break the bad news to the duchess. With the empty box clasped to her chest, Irene strode nervously toward the palace."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,38,"But then her feet stopped moving and her mouth fell open. She stared. Maybe this was impossible, yet there it was, a little way off and over to the right, hugging the trunk of a tree - the beautiful ball gown! The wind was holding it there."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,39,"'Mama!' Irene shouted. 'Mama, I found it!'"
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,40,"She managed somehow, despite the wind's meddling, to get the gown off the tree and back in its box. And in another moment she was at the door of the palace. She knocked twice with the big brass knocker. The door opened and she burst in."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,41,"She was welcomed by cheering servants and a delirious duchess. They couldn't believe she had come over the mountain in such a storm, all by herself. She had to tell the whole story, every detail. And she did."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,42,"Then she asked to be taken right back to her sick mother. But it was out of the question, they said; the road that ran around the mountain wouldn't be cleared till morning."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,43,"'Don't fret, child,' said the duchess. 'Your mother is surely sleeping now. We'll get you there first thing tomorrow.'"
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,44,"Irene was given a good dinner as she sat by the fire, the moisture steaming off her clothes. The duchess, meanwhile, got into her freshly ironed gown before the guests began arriving in their sleighs."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,45,"What a wonderful ball it was! The duchess in her new gown was like a bright star in the sky. Irene in her ordinary dress was radiant. She was swept up into dances by handsome aristocrats, who kept her feet off the floor to spare her ankle. Her mother would enjoy hearing all about it."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,46,"Early the next morning, when snow had long since ceased falling, Mrs. Bobbin woke from a good night's sleep feeling much improved. She hurried about and got a fire going in the cold stove. Then she went to look in on Irene."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,47,But Irene's bed was empty! She ran to the window and gazed at the white landscape. No one out there. Snow powder fell from the branch of a tree.
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,48,'Where is my child?' Mrs. Bobbin cried. She whipped on her coat to go out and find her.
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,49,"When she pulled the door open, a wall of drift faced her. But peering over it, she could see a horse-drawn sleigh hastening up the path. And seated on the sleigh, between two large footmen, was Irene herself, asleep but smiling."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,50,Would you like to hear the rest?
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,51,"Well, there was a bearded doctor in the back of the sleigh. And the duchess had sent Irene's mother a ginger cake with white icing, some oranges and a pineapple, and spice candy of many flavors, along with a note saying how much she cherished her gown, and what a brave and loving person Irene was."
L239,BRAVE IRENE,WILLIAM STEIG,52,"Which, of course, Mrs. Bobbin knew. Better than the duchess."

L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,122,I'll lie flat
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,123,"upon the mat,"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,124,but I'm not counting sheep!
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,125,"You can snooze,"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,126,but I refuse.

L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,135,"and stomp the whole way through,"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,136,just like a bunch of animals
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,137,until we reach the zoo!
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,138,[[Zoo]]
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,139,Best Friends
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,140,Heather was my best friend
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,141,"this morning on the bus,"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,142,but she talked so much to Shauna
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,143,that I made my best friend Gus.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,144,But Gus said he was Noah's friend
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,145,and wouldn't take it back-
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,146,so I had to go and trade him
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,147,"for a better best friend, Zack."
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,148,"Zack wouldn't share the box of blocks,"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,149,so what else could I do?
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,150,"At lunchtime, I sat right down beside"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,151,"my newest best friend, Sue."
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,152,Then Sue ate half my cupcake.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,153,I didn't say she could!
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,154,"In Art, I was all by myself-"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,155,I was done with friends for good!
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,156,"Then someone came and asked me,"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,157,'Can we paint together?'
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,158,"So... on the bus ride home again,"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,159,"my new, NEW best friend was Heather."
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,160,George
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,161,I have a Kindergarten friend who isn't very big.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,162,"I'm talking bout George Washington, our classroom guinea pig."
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,163,I always stop to talk to him about the stuff we like.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,164,I tell him what's on TV and how to ride a bike.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,165,I'm teaching him his ABCs and how to draw a heart.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,166,He always pays attention-that George is clearly very smart!
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,167,100th Day of School
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,168,I brought 100 marbles
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,169,inside my plastic cup.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,170,Zack brought 100 chocolate chips
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,171,(till someone ate them up).
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,172,Nina's 100 toothpicks
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,173,all came inside one box.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,174,Alia brought a picture
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,175,of her 100 chicken pox.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,176,I used to think 100
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,177,"was a lot when I was small,"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,178,"but now that it's the 100th day,"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,179,I am old enough to say-
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,180,"100 isn't all that many, many days at all!"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,181,Show-and-Tell
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,182,"Today's my turn for show-and-tell,"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,183,but somehow I forgot!
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,184,I could have brought in cuddle bear
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,185,or else my new robot. 
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,186,I could have brought my snow globe
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,187,or my cool vacation hat.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,188,I could have brought my goldfish-
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,189,except I didn't think of that.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,190,So now my hands are empty
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,191,and my teacher's calling me!
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,192,But hang on! I see something
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,193,staring right in front of me.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,194,Quick! I draw two dots
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,195,on my finger while I stand.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,196,Then I make my thumb into a mouth-
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,197,"'Hi, class, Please meet my HAND!'"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,198,Line Leaders

L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,202,But I go s l o w l y...
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,203,I don't run...
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,204,cause I'm the line leader!
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,205,I was picked the line leader!
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,206,"So make way, kids"
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,207,for number one!
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,208,Growing Seeds
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,209,We planted seeds in paper cups
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,210,and put them on the sill.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,211,We watered them
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,212,and watched...
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,213,and watched...
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,214,and watched those cups until...
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,215,I peeked today and-check it out-
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,216,a little baby seeding sprout!
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,217,Growing Me
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,218,What happened to my favorite pants?
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,219,The ones that used to fit.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,220,Now they come up to my knees
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,221,when I try to sit.
L240,"KINDERGARTEN, HERE I COME!",D.J. STEINBERG,222,My toes can't wiggle in my shoes

L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,1,I am Eloise
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,2,I am six
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,3,I am a city child
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,4,I live at The Plaza
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,5,There is a lobby which is enormously large
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,6,with marble pillars and ladies in it and a revolving
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,7,door with P on it
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,8,I spend an awful lot of time in the lobby
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,9,For instance every day I have to go to the
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,10,Desk Clerk and see what's happening there
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,11,Then I stop by the Mail Desk to see if they have any stamps
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,12,Then I go to the House Phones
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,13,and make several calls to see
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,14,if anybody's in
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,15,The Bell Captain knows who I am
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,16,If there is a lot of luggage trying to get in the elevator
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,17,and these people are all in a crowd and smoking and from
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,18,"out of town or something, I edge into the middle of it an"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,19,lose my skate key
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,20,I am a nuisance in the lobby
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,21,Mr. Salomone said so
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,22,He is the manager
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,23,"I always say ""Good morning, Mr. Salomone"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,24,"and he always says ""Good morning, Eloise"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,25,My mother knows The Owner
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,26,I live on the top floor
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,27,Of course I am apt to be on any floor at any time
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,28,And if I want to go anywhere I simply take the elevator
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,29,For instance if I happen to be on the second floor I just
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,30,press that button until it comes up and as soon as that
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,31,"door is open I get in and say ""5th floor please"" and"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,32,when those doors clank shut we ride up and I get out on
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,33,the 5th floor and as soon that elevator is out of
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,34,sight I skibble up those stairs to the 8th floor and then
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,35,I press that button and when that same elevator comes up and
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,36,"as soon as that door is open I get in and say ""15th floor"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,37,"please"" and then when those doors clank shut we ride up"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,38,and I get out on the 15th floor and as soon as that elevator
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,39,is out of sight I skibble down to the 12th floor and press
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,40,that button and when that same elevator comes up and those
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,41,"doors open I say ""The Lobby please"" and then those doors"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,42,clank shut and we ride down without saying absolutely one word
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,43,and then I get into the next elevator and go all the way up.
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,44,Then I get off at the top floor
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,45,And I look in the mirror at me
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,46,ELOISE
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,47,I live down at the end of the hall
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,48,Sometimes I take two sticks and skidder them along the walls
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,49,And when I run down the hall I slomp my feet against the
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,50,woodwork which is very good for scuffing and noise
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,51,Sometimes I slomp my skates if I want to make a really loud
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,52,and terrible racket
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,53,We have a buzzer on our front door
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,54,I always lean on it
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,55,That's how Nanny knows it's me
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,56,ELOISE
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,57,Nanny is my nurse
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,58,She wears tissue paper in her dress
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,59,and you can hear it
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,60,She is English and has 8 hairpins
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,61,made out of bones
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,62,She says that's all she needs in
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,63,this life for Lord's sake
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,64,Nanny says she would rawther I didn't
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,65,talk talk talk all the time
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,66,She always says everything 3 times
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,67,like Eloise you cawn't cawn't cawn't
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,68,Sometimes I hit her on the ankle with a tassel
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,69,She is my mostly companion
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,70,I have my own room
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,71,It has a coat rack which is as large as me
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,72,[[ELOISE]]
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,73,I have a dog that looks like a cat
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,74,His name is Weenie
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,75,Sometimes I put sunglasses on him
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,76,Then I have to scratch his back with a wire hanger
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,77,I have a turtle
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,78,His name is Skipperdee
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,79,He eats raisins and wears sneakers
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,80,The Plaza is the only hotel in New York
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,81,that will allow you to have a turtle
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,82,Skipperdee and me we always know it's morning
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,83,because Weenie breathes in our face and kisses us
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,84,The absolutely first thing I have to do
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,85,is braid Skipperdee's ears
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,86,Otherwise he gets cross and develops a rash
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,87,Nanny gets up feeling tired tired tired
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,88,and puts on her kimono
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,89,and skibbles over to slam those windows
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,90,down shut so that we don't
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,91,freeze freeze freeze
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,92,Then she stretches her muscles
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,93,and feels fresh fresh fresh
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,94,Nanny yawns out loud
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,95,Then I pick up the telephone
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,96,and call Room Service
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,97,Ooooooooo I absolutely love Room Service
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,98,They always know its me
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,99,"and they say ""Yes, Eloise?"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,100,"And I always say ""Hello, this is me ELOISE and would you"

L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,102,to the top floor and charge it please
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,103,"Thank you very much"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,104,Then I hang up and look at the ceiling
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,105,for a while and think of a
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,106,way to get a present
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,107,I usually yawn out loud several times
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,108,Then Nanny gives the signal and Weenie and Skipperdee and me
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,109,we skibble out of bed as fast as everly we can and Nanny wraps
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,110,us in our robe and holds us tight
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,111,And I pat her on her botto
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,112,which is large
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,113,Then we have to do our morning duties and laugh and sing
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,114,London from bottom to top is zup
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,115,The keeper in the shop is zup

L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,134,Ooooooooo I just love Nanny I absolutely do
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,135,While I'm brushing my teeth there is this pigeon who it always
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,136,hanging around our bathroom window and he does absolutely nothing
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,137,but coo
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,138,He is fat and grisly and I holler at him and he
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,139,flies over to the Sherry-Netherland for a while to see what they're

L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,143,Skipperdee weighs absolutely nothing at all

L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,145,Then of course he weighs 1/2
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,146,Then Nanny puts on her corset which is
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,147,enormously large but which is very good for her back
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,148,Kleenex makes a very good hat
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,149,When we are clean we skibble in our scuffs to the kitchen

L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,158,Nanny likes her coffee hot hot hot
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,159,An egg cup makes a very good hat
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,160,I have two dolls which is enough
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,161,Their names are Sabine and Saylor
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,162,Sabine is a rag doll and she has absolutely no face at all
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,163,partially because she came from Jamaica by Air Express
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,164,Otherwise she has shoe-button eyes and two right legs
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,165,She is rawther unusual
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,166,Saylor is a very large doll and has a hard head and no arms
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,167,She was in the most terriblest accident and she bleeded so hard
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,168,she almost choked in the night and this ambulance came and took
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,169,her to this hospital and it was an emergency and they had to give
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,170,her all this terribly dark medicine and a lot of Band-aids and when
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,171,she came back home she was weak weak weak and had to take cod-liver
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,172,oil
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,173,I gave her a strawberry leaf from under my grapefruit for not
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,174,whimpering and Weenie licked her face
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,175,"They have to have a teaspoon of water every hour or so, so you can"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,176,see they are an extremely lot of extra work
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,177,[[Hospital]]
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,178,[[X-ray]]
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,179,Here's what I like to do

L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,189,Get dizzy and fall down
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,190,Make a terrible face
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,191,And here's the thing of it
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,192,Most of the time I'm on the telephone
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,193,My day is rawther full
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,194,I have to call the Valet and tell him
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,195,to get here and pick up
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,196,my sneakers to be cleaned and pressed
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,197,and have them back for
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,198,sure without fail
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,199,Then I have to play the piano
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,200,and look in the mirror for a while
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,201,Then I have to open and close the door for a while and as
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,202,soon as I hear talking and laughing I skidder out and run down
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,203,the hall
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,204,and if there is an open door I have
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,205,to walk in and pretend I am an orphan
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,206,and sometimes I limp and sort of bend
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,207,to the side and look sort of
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,208,sad in between the arms
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,209,and they give me a piece of melon or something
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,210,Then I roam around the halls
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,211,Then I have to scurry down to the 10th floor to adjust those
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,212,thermostats in case anyone needs it
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,213,If there's a fire on the 6th floor
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,214,I know how to fix it
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,215,Then I have to hide and see what those Hotel Officers are up to
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,216,All they do is walk and talk
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,217,I have never been arrested
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,218,Then I have to hurry back to the top floor
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,219,Our day maid's name is Johanna
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,220,She has earrings with garnets
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,221,and is going to take her Social Security
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,222,to Bavaria on her birthday
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,223,One time she saw this man in this hair net
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,224,and he bawled her out for taking his razor blades
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,225,I have to help her put on those
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,226,pillowcases or she'll never be through
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,227,by 4 for Lord's sake
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,228,She has to be through by 4
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,229,Then I have to go around to that Service Elevator on the 6th floor
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,230,"and see what everybody's thrown away and if I want it or not, like"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,231,ribbon or something like that
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,232,Then I have to go down to help the Switchboard Operators
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,233,in case there are any D As and there has to be
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,234,some sort of message taken or something like that
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,235,If there is an Exit sign I always have to go into it because there
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,236,might be a mattress in there and I can lie down on it and get some
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,237,rest so I can carry on for Lord's sake
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,238,Oh my Lord I am absolutely so busy I don't know how I can possibly
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,239,get everything done
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,240,Then I have to hop around for a while
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,241,I have lunch at the Palm Court if it is too rainy
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,242,and see Thomas
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,243,We are both rawther fond of talking and he gives
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,244,me Gugelhopfen
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,245,Thomas has a son in the Marines who got married
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,246,on a shoestring
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,247,Thomas has a Corvette
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,248,I always go in the Persian Room after 4 to see my friend Bill
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,249,He is a busboy in the night and goes to school in the day and
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,250,his eyes water
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,251,Here's where he's been
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,252,Madrid
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,253,Here's where I've been
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,254,Boiler Room
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,255,I go to the Powder Room
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,256,as often as I can
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,257,You just step on it
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,258,Then I scamper to the Terrace Room
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,259,where those debutantes are prancing around
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,260,Then I have to skibble into the Baroque Room because sometimes
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,261,there is this chalk and there is this pitcher with ice water in it and you
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,262,should see the cigar smoke left over from a General Motors meeting
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,263,Oh my Lord
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,264,Then I have to help the busboys and waiters get set up in the
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,265,Crystal Room
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,266,They always wait until the last second for Lord's sake and then
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,267,we have to rush our feet off
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,268,I go to all the weddings in the White and Gold room
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,269,and I usually stay for the reception
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,270,There are absolutely nothing but rooms in the Plaza
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,271,Sometimes if they are having this enormous affair
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,272,in the Grand Ballroom I get there early to help Joe
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,273,set up the lights in the ceiling and before anybody gets
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,274,there we just scamper up this ladder and hide up there
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,275,in those holes
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,276,Oh my Lord is it ever swelteringly hot up there
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,277,I always wear my sun visor
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,278,I am all over the hotel
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,279,Half the time I am lost
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,280,But mostly I am on the first floor because
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,281,that's where Catering is
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,282,So I have to go down there every day for at least
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,283,three hours and sometimes I have to go at night
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,284,Oh my Lord do they ever have a lot of things going on
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,285,down there
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,286,Altogether I have been to 56 affairs including Halloween
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,287,There is this Oak Room which is to the right if you want to have
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,288,a broken mint or something like that
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,289,And you have to go downstairs
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,290,to the Rendezvous Room which is
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,291,very good for hiding over a long
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,292,period of time and for doing
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,293,a tour jetÃ© or so
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,294,The Package Room has all these packages in it and sometimes
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,295,I have to help them lift those heavy boxes and look for small
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,296,packages that might be for me ELOISE
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,297,Sometimes I go into the Men's Room which is very good for playing
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,298,Railroad Station or something like that
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,299,Every Wednesday I have to go to the Barber Shop
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,300,and have Vincent shape my hair
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,301,He does absolutely nothing but talk and swiggles
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,302,me around in that chair and hurts my neck with
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,303,that whiskbroom
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,304,Sometimes I sklonk him in the kneecap
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,305,Vincent says that if I am not careful I am not going
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,306,to have a hair on my head by the time I'm 7 for Lord's sake
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,307,Getting bored is not allowed
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,308,Sometimes I comb my hair with a fork
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,309,Sometimes I wear my arm in a sling
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,310,Sometimes I put a rubber band
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,311,on the end of my nose
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,312,Toe shoes make very good ears
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,313,Sometimes I wear them to lunch
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,314,Here's what I like to do
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,315,Pretend
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,316,Sometimes I am a mother with 40 children
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,317,Sometimes I am a giant with fire coming out of my hair
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,318,Sometimes I get terribly sick and have to be waited on
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,319,Sometimes I get so sick my head falls over and is wobbling until
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,320,it is loose
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,321,Then we have to call my mother long distance and charge it
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,322,My mother is 30 and has a charge account at Bergdorf's
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,323,She wears a 3 1/2 shoe
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,324,I put a large cabbage leaf on my head
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,325,when I have a headache
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,326,It makes a very good hat
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,327,My mother knows Lily DachÃ©
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,328,She goes to Europe and to Paris
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,329,And when she goes to Miami she stays at the Roney
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,330,and sends for me if there's some sun
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,331,I am always packed in case I have to leave on TWA
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,332,at a moment's notice or something like that
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,333,My mother has A T & T stock and she knows an ad man
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,334,whatever that is
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,335,Sometimes my mother goes to Virginia
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,336,with her lawyer
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,337,He has an office on Madison Avenue
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,338,He has already had the whooping
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,339,cough and the measles
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,340,Sometimes I give him rubber candy
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,341,He is absolutely so dumb he eats it
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,342,Sometimes he brings me a present
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,343,whether I deserve it or not
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,344,I usually do

L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,347,Here's what I like
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,348,Grass
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,349,Sometimes I have a temper fit
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,350,But not very often
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,351,I absolutely dislike school
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,352,so Philip is my tutor
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,353,He goes to Andover
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,354,My mother knows the Dean
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,355,He wears red garters and is boring boring boring
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,356,When we have our French lesson he reads in French about la petite
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,357,cousine de Marie and her jardin and sometimes I listen to him but
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,358,not very often
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,359,Here's what makes Philip angry
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,360,"He says ""Alors! nous commenÃ§erons"" and I say ""Alors! nous"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,361,"commencerons"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,362,"And he says ""Shall we settle down Eloise? And I say ""Shall we"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,363,"settle down Eloise?"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,364,"And he says ""That's quite enough Eloise"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,365,"And I saw ""That's quite enough Eloise"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,366,"And he says ""I meant it Eloise"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,367,"And I saw ""I meant it Eloise"" right back at him"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,368,And he looks at me with fiercely eyes
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,369,"and then he says ""That will do Eloise"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,370,"And then I say ""That will do Eloise"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,371,"And then he shouts ""Eloise I mean it"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,372,"And then I shout ""Eloise I mean it"" right after him"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,373,"And then he gets madder and says ""Stop it at once Eloise"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,374,"And then I say ""Stop it at once Eloise"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,375,"And then he stands up and says ""Very well Eloise"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,376,"And then I stand up and say ""Very well Eloise"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,377,And then he walks around the room
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,378,And then I walk around the room
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,379,"And then he screams ""Nanny"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,380,"Then I scream ""Nanny"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,381,"And Nanny comes in yelling ""Non non non Eloise"" and she claps her"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,382,hands and Skipperdee and me we skibble over and hide behind the
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,383,television or fall dead behind a hidden door
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,384,And then Nanny puts her arm around Philip and calls Room Service
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,385,"and says ""Send three of everything please"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,386,And when the waiter brings the check Nanny signs my mother's name
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,387,"And I simply tell him to ""charge it please and thank you very much"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,388,Then I do a cartwheel
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,389,Philip is always glad to go home
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,390,Every night I have to call Room Service to send up that menu
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,391,so we can order our dinner for Lord's sake
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,392,I always have to read it for a few seconds or so
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,393,"then I just say ""I'll have the Planked Medallion of Beef Tenderloin"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,394,"with Fresh Vegetables Maison please and two raisins, one strawberry"
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,395,leaf and one clams in season s'il vous plÃ¢it and charge it please
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,396,"Thank you very much"""
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,397,Ooooooooooooooooo I absolutely love Room Service
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,398,The night maid's name is Lily
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,399,She married the engineer of the subway and cut her hair
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,400,but I think she's sorry
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,401,She gives us extra pillowcases and soap
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,402,Once there was this most terriblest storm that came up and
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,403,it rained and all this thunder was clomping itself into
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,404,this water and all these people were drowning without air
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,405,Absolutely no one was saved
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,406,Paper cups are very good for talking to Mars
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,407,TV is in the Drawing Room
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,408,I always watch it with my parasol in case there's some sort of glare
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,409,And oh my Lord when it's fight night Nanny is absolutely wild and we
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,410,have to scamper into our places and get ready and Nanny has to find
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,411,her Players and I have to get my binoculars and call Room Service
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,412,and order three Pilsner beers for Nanny and one meringue glacee
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,413,for me ELOISE and charge it please
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,414,Thank you very much
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,415,Here's what I hate
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,416,Howdy Doody
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,417,Ooooooooooooooooooo I absolutely love TV
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,418,Every night when it's time to go to bed Nanny yawns out loud
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,419,and says she is tired tired tired
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,420,I make as much noise as I possibly can like turning on the phonograph
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,421,real loud and hollering a lot
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,422,Then I have to brush Nanny's hair
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,423,for her
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,424,And then we both yawn out loud and
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,425,get into our pajamas
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,426,Then I have to put on my Don't Disturb sign and get Skipperdee and
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,427,Weenie and me all tucked in and then Nanny opens the windows
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,428,enormously wide so we can have air air air
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,429,Then she turns out the light
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,430,[DON'T DISTURB]
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,431,Nanny has a mole
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,432,Sometimes we go to sleep right away
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,433,But not very often
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,434,Sometimes Weenie and Skipperdee and me we get out of bed and go
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,435,into that closet and look around for a while and when we get back in there
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,436,there is this cave and it is so dark in there that it's absolutely black
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,437,and there is this big bug in there that has those enormously large
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,438,feathers and he picks up by our necks and sklanks us around in his
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,439,paws and carries us down into this deep well that is all filled with
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,440,tigers and lions and birds of prey and they eat us up raw and step
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,441,on us and stamp their feet on us and absolutely rank us
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,442,and we have to run for our lives and drag each other on our stomach
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,443,and scrape our face along the side until we are absolutely breathing
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,444,and stretching our arms to reach that closet door barely in time
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,445,and our heart is beating and we have to wake Nanny with a flashlight
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,446,in her face to save us and put witch hazel and cotton on all of our
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,447,toenails
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,448,And Nanny has to get up and pamper me and spoil me for a while
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,449,while I am out of my head with fever and pain
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,450,After all I am only 6
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,451,Oh my Lord
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,452,There's so much to do
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,453,Tomorrow I think I'll pour a pitcher of water down the mail chute
L243,ELOISE,KAY THOMPSON,454,Ooooooooooooooooooo I absolutely love the Plaza
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,1,"On the night you were born,"
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,2,the moon smiled with such wonder
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,3,that the stars peeked into see you
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,4,"and the night wind whispered,"
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,5,'Life will never be the same.'
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,6,Because there had never been anyone like you...
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,7,ever in the world.
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,8,So enchanted with you were the wind and the rain
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,9,that they whispered the sound of your wonderful name.
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,10,The sound of your name is a magical one.
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,11,Let's say it out loud before we go on.
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,12,It sailed through the farmland
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,13,high on the breeze...
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,14,Who in the world is exactly like you
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,15,Who Who Who
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,16,Over the ocean...
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,17,And through the trees...
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,18,Until everyone heard it
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,19,and everyone knew
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,20,of the one and only ever you.
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,21,"Not once had there been such eyes,"
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,22,"such a nose,"
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,23,"such silly, wiggly, wonderful toes."
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,24,"In fact, I think I'll count to three"
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,25,so you can wiggle your toes for me.
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,26,When the polar bears hear

L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,28,"From faraway places,"
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,29,the geese flew home.
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,30,The moon stayed up until morning next day.
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,31,And none of the ladybugs flew away.
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,32,So whenever you doubt just how special you are
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,33,"and you wonder who loves you, how much and how far,"
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,34,listen for geese honking high in the sky.
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,35,(They're singing as song to remember you by.)
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,36,Or notice the bears asleep at the zoo.
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,37,(It's because they've been dancing all night for you!)
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,38,Or drift off to sleep to the sound of the wind.
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,39,(Listen closely...it's whispering your name again!)
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,40,"If the moon stays up until morning one day,"
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,41,"or a ladybug lands and decides to stay,"
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,42,"or a little bird sits at your window awhile,"
L244,ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN,NANCY TILLMAN,43,it's because they're all hoping to see you smile...

L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,1,Six times Miss Hester's dog Fritz had bitten dear
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,2,cousin Eunice. So when Miss Hester received an
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,3,invitation to visit Eunice she was not surprised to 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,4,"read 'P.S., Please leave your dog home.' On the"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,5,day of her visit Miss Hester asked young Alan Mitz
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,6,to stay with Fritz and give his afternoon walk.
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,7,"As soon as Miss Hester left, Fritz ran into the parlor."
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,8,He loved to chew on the chairs and shake the stuff-
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,9,ing out of the pillows. But Alan was ready. All 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,10,morning long he kept Fritz from sinking his sharp
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,11,little teeth into the furniture. Finally the dog gave
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,12,"up and fell asleep, exhausted. Alan took a nap, too,"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,13,"but first he hid his hat under his shirt, hats being on"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,14,of Fritz's favorite things to chew. 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,15,An hour later Alan quickly awoke when Fritz gave 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,16,him a bite on the nose. The bad-mannered dog was
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,17,ready for his afternoon walk. Alan fastened Fritz's
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,18,leash and the dog dragged him out of the house.
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,19,"Walking along, they discovered a small white bridge"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,20,at the side of the road. Alan decided to let Fritz lead
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,21,the way across.
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,22,Some distance beyond the bridge Alan stopped to 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,23,"read a sign. It said: ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY NO"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,24,DOGS ALLOWED IN THIS GARDEN. At the bottom it 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,25,"was signed: ABDUL GASAZI, RETIRED MAGICIAN."
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,26,Behind the sign stood a vine-covered wall with an 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,27,open doorway. Alan took the warning quite seriously.
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,28,"He turned to leave, but as he did, Fritz gave a "
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,29,tremendous tug and snapped right out of his collar.
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,30,"He bolted straight ahead through the open door,"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,31,with Alan running right behind. 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,32,"'Fritz, stop, you bad dog!' cried Alan, but the dog"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,33,simply ignored him. Down shadowed paths and 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,34,"across sunlit lawns they raced, deeper and deeper"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,35,"into the garden. Finally, Alan drew close enough to "
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,36,grab hold of Fritz. But as he reached out he slipped 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,37,and fell. Fritz barked with laughter as he galloped
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,38,out of sight. Alan slowly picked himself up. He
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,39,knew he had to find Fritz before Mr. Gasazi discov-
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,40,"ered him. Bruised and tired, he hurried off in the"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,41,dog's direction.
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,42,After a long search Alan was ready to give up. He
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,43,was afraid he might never find Fritz. But then he
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,44,came upon fresh dog prints. Slowly he followed 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,45,Fritz's tracks along a path that led into a forest. The
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,46,dirt path ended and a brick walk began. There were
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,47,"no more tracks to follow, but Alan was certain that"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,48,Fritz must be just ahead. 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,49,Alan started running. In front of him he could see a 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,50,clearing in the forest. As he came dashing out of the 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,51,woods he stopped as quickly as if he had run up
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,52,"against a wall. For there, in front of him, stood a "
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,53,truly awesome sight. It was the house of Gasazi.
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,54,"Alan nervously climbed the great stairs, convinced"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,55,Fritz had come this way and been captured.
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,56,The boy's heart was pounding when he arrived at
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,57,the huge door. He took a deep breath and reached
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,58,"for the bell, but before he touched it the door swung "
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,59,"open. There, in the shadow of the hallway, stood"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,60,"Gasazi the Great. 'Greetings, do come in' was all"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,61,that he said. 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,62,Alan followed Gasazi into a large room. When the
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,63,magician turned around Alan quickly apologized for
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,64,letting Fritz into the garden. He politely asked that 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,65,"if Mr. Gasazi had Fritz, would he please give him"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,66,"back? The magician listened carefully and then,"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,67,"smiling, said, 'Certainly you may have your little"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,68,Fritzie. Follow me.' With those words he went to
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,69,the door and led Alan back outside.
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,70,They were walking across the lawn when suddenly
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,71,Gasazi stopped by a gathering of ducks. He began to 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,72,speak in a voice that was more like a growl. 'I
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,73,"detest dogs. They dig up my flowers, they chew on "
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,74,my trees. Do you know what I do to dogs I find in
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,75,"my garden?' 'What?' whispered Alan, almost "
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,76,afraid to hear the answer. 'I TURN THEM INTO
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,77,"DUCKS!' bellowed Gasazi. In horror, Alan looked"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,78,at the birds in front of him. When one duck came 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,79,"forward, Gasazi said, 'There's your Fritz.' Alan "
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,80,begged the magician to change Fritz back. 'Impos-
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,81,"sible,' he answered, 'only time can do that. This "
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,82,spell may last years or perhaps just a day. Now take
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,83,your dear bird and please don't come again.'
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,84,When Alan took the bird in his arms it tried to give
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,85,"him a bite. 'Good old boy,' said Alan sadly as he"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,86,patted the bird on the head. 'You really haven't
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,87,changed so much.' With tears in his eyes he started
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,88,for home. Behind him Alan could hear Gasazi
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,89,"laughing. As he approached the stairway, a gust of"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,90,wind took Alan's hat sailing right off his head. Run-
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,91,"ning along with one arm reaching for the hat, Alan"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,92,lost his hold on Fritz. The duck flew out ahead and
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,93,grabbed the hat in midair. But instead of landing he
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,94,"just kept on flying, higher and higher, until he disap-"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,95,peared in the afternoon clouds. 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,96,Alan just stood and stared at the empty sky. 'Good-
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,97,"bye, old fellow,' he called out sadly, sure that Fritz"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,98,was gone forever. At least he had something to chew
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,99,"on. Slowly, one step after another, Alan found his "
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,100,way back to the garden gate and over the bridge. It
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,101,was sunset by the time he reached Miss Hester's.
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,102,Lights were on and he knew she must be home.
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,103,"With a heavy heart he approached the door, wonder-"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,104,ing how Miss Hester would take the news. 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,105,When Miss Hester came to the door Alan blurted
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,106,out his incredible story. He could barely hold back
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,107,"the tears; then, racing out of the kitchen, dog food on"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,108,"his nose, came Fritz. Alan couldn't believe his eyes."
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,109,"'I'm afraid Mr. Gasazi played a trick on you,' said"
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,110,"Miss Hester, trying to hide a smile. 'Fritz was in the "
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,111,front yard when I returned. He must have found his 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,112,own way home while you were with Mr. Gasazi. You
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,113,"see, Alan, no one can really turn dogs into ducks; "
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,114,that old magician just made you think that duck was
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,115,Fritz.
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,116,Alan felt very silly. He promised himself he'd never
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,117,be fooled like that again. He was too old to believe
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,118,in magic. Miss hester watched from the porch as 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,119,Alan waved goodbye and hurried down the road to 
L247,THE GARDEN OF ABDUL GASAZI,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,120,"go home. Then she called out to Fritz, who was"

L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,1,"In a cave in the woods,"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,2,"in his deep, dark lair,"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,3,"through the long, cold winter"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,4,sleeps a great brown bear.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,5,"Cuddled in a heap,"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,6,"with his eyes shut tight,"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,7,"he sleeps through the day,"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,8,he sleeps through the night.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,9,The cold winds howl
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,10,and the night sounds growl.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,11,But
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,12,the bear 
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,13,snores on.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,14,"An itty-bitty mouse,"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,15,"pitter-pat, tip-toe,"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,16,creep-crawls in the cave
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,17,from the fluff-cold snow.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,18,"Mouse squeaks, 'Too damp,"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,19,"too dank, too dark.'"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,20,So he lights wee twigs
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,21,"with a small, hot spark."
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,22,The coals pip-pop and the wind doesn't stop.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,23,But
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,24,the bear 
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,25,snores on.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,26,Two glowing eyes
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,27,sneak-peek in the den.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,28,"Mouse cries, 'Who's there?'"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,29,and a hare hops in.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,30,"'Ho, Mouse!' says Hare."
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,31,"'Long time, no see!'"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,32,So they pop white corn.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,33,And they brew black tea.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,34,Mouse sips wee slurps.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,35,Hare burps big BURPS!
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,36,But
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,37,the bear 
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,38,snores on.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,39,"A badger scuttles by,"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,40,sniff-snuffs at the air.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,41,'I smell yummy-yums!
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,42,Perhaps we can share?
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,43,"'I've brought honey-nuts,'"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,44,Badger says with a grin.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,45,"'Let's divvy them up,"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,46,cozy down ... and dig in!'
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,47,And they nibble and they munch with a
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,48,CHEW-
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,49,CHOMP-
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,50,CRUNCH!
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,51,But
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,52,the bear 
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,53,snores on.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,54,A gopher and a mole
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,55,tunnel up through the floor.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,56,Then a wren and a raven
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,57,flutter in through the door!
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,58,"Mole mutters, 'What a night!'"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,59,'When a storm!' twitters Wren.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,60,And everybody clutters
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,61,in the great bear's den.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,62,They tweet and they titter. They chat and they chitter.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,63,But
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,64,the bear 
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,65,snores on.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,66,"In a cave in the woods,"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,67,a slumbering bear
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,68,sleeps through the party
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,69,in his very own lair.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,70,Hare stokes the fire.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,71,Mouse seasons stew.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,72,Then a small pepper fleck 
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,73,makes the bear .......
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,74,RAAAAA-CHOOOOOOO!!!!
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,75,"He blow and he sneezes,"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,76,and the whole crowd freezes ...
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,77,And 
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,78,the bear
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,79,WAKES UP!
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,80,BEAR GNARLS
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,81,and he SNARLS.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,82,BEAR ROARS
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,83,and he RUMBLES!
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,84,BEAR JUMPS
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,85,and he STOMPS.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,86,BEAR GROWLS
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,87,and he GRUMBLES!
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,88,'You've snuck in my lair
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,89,and you've all had fun!
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,90,But me? I was sleeping
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,91,And...
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,92,I have had none!'
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,93,And he whimpers
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,94,"and he moans, "
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,95,he wails and he groans...
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,96,And the bear blubbers on!
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,97,"Mouse squeaks, 'Don't fret."
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,98,"Don't fuss. Look, see?"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,99,We can pop more corn!
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,100,We can brew more tea!'
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,101,Bear gulps. Bear gobbles.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,102,He sighs with delight.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,103,Then he spins tall tales
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,104,through the blustery night.
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,105,When the sun peeks up
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,106,"on a crisp, clear dawn,"
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,107,Bear can't sleep ...
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,108,But
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,109,his friends
L252,BEAR SNORES ON,KARMA WILSON,110,snore on.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,1,Twas the night before Mother's Day
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,2,"when, as quiet as a mouse,"
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,3,Dad told us his plan
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,4,to get Mom out of the house.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,5,Her sneakers were set by the doorway with care
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,6,in hopes that her running pals soon would be there.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,7,Then out in the yard
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,8,there arose quite a crowd.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,9,"'Come on! Let's go, girl!'"
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,10,her friends shouted real loud.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,11,So Mom in her sweat suit and red baseball cap
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,12,plugged in her earphones...
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,13,and jogged off in a snap.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,14,Away to the kitchen we flew like a flash
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,15,as if we were running a one-hundred-yard dash!
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,16,We measured and mixed
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,17,"a delicious cake batter,"
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,18,then blended the frosting-oops!
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,19,Way too much splatter!
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,20,We made fancy cards
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,21,"adding our 'I Love Yous,'"
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,22,and a special coupon
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,23,that Mom sure could use.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,24,"When Mom came home, she saw the mess in the sink."
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,25,'What'd I miss?'
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,26,she asked.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,27,"'Nothing,' Dad said"
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,28,with a wink.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,29,We children then nestled
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,30,"all snug in our beds,"
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,31,while visions of Mom
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,32,danced in our heads.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,33,The next morning we presented a giant bouquet.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,34,"'It's for you, Mom!' we cried. 'Happy Mother's Day!'"
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,35,She read both of our cards
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,36,"and, after wiping her eyes,"
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,37,"said, 'A private spa session!"
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,38,What a lovely surprise.'
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,39,We took Mom to the kitchen
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,40,where our spa was set up.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,41,Dad served her black coffee
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,42,in an extra large cup.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,43,We rubbed her shoulders.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,44,We massaged her feet.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,45,Mom sighed and smiled.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,46,'You kids are so sweet.'
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,47,I wrapped a towel turban
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,48,"to cover her hair,"
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,49,then we dabbed on a mud mask.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,50,No mess anywhere!
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,51,I painted her nails.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,52,What a glittery fun!
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,53,A top coat of polish-
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,54,voilà! Manicure done!
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,55,"Dad said, 'The chef will be serving"
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,56,a divine gourmet brunch.'
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,57,(That's a meal that comes
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,58,between breakfast and lunch.)
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,59,So Mom hurried off
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,60,to go and get dressed.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,61,"We took seats at the table,"
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,62,behaving our best.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,63,When what to our wondering eyes should appear-
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,64,but the perfect model for Mother of the Year!
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,65,Her eyes-
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,66,how they sparkled!
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,67,Her brown hair-
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,68,how curly!
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,69,Her cheeks were
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,70,"like roses,"
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,71,her skirt-
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,72,very twirly!
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,73,We raised our juice glasses
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,74,and offered a toast:
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,75,'To the World's Greatest Mom!
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,76,And that's not a boast.'
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,77,Mom thanked us for everything-
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,78,it brought her such cheer.
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,79,She wished it could be a Mother's Day
L253,THE NIGHT BEFORE MOTHER'S DAY,NATASHA WING,80,every day of the year.
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,1,LITTLE BO-PEEP
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,2,"Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep,"
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,3,And can't tell where to find them;
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,4,"Leave them alone, and they'll come home,"
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,5,And bring their tails behind them.
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,6,"Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep,"
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,7,And dreamt she heard them bleating;
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,8,"But when she awoke, she found it a joke,"
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,9,For still they all were fleeting.
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,10,"Then up she took her little crook,"
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,11,Determined for to find them;
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,12,"She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,"
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,13,For they'd left all their tails behind 'em!
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,14,"It happened one day, as Bo-peep did stray"
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,15,Unto a meadow hard by--
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,16,"There she espied their tails, side by side,"
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,17,All hung on a tree to dry.
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,18,"She heaved a sigh and wiped her eye,"
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,19,And over the hillocks she raced;
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,20,"And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should,"
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,21,That each tail should be properly placed.
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,22,LITTLE BOY BLUE
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,23,"Little Boy Blue, come, blow your horn!"
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,24,"The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn."
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,25,Where's the little boy that looks after the sheep?
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,26,"Under the haystack, fast asleep!"
L254,THE REAL MOTHER GOOSE,BLANCHE FISHER WRIGHT,27,RAIN
