M1,"BARK, GEORGE",JULES FEIFFER,48,Hello
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,1,"One day, Little Sal went with her mother to Blueberry Hill to pick blueberries."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,2,Little Sal brought along her small tin pail and her mother brought her large tin pail to put berries in.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,3,"We will take our berries home and can them, said her mother."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,4,Then we will have food for the winter.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,5,"Little Sal picked three berries and dropped them in her little tin pail . . . Kuplink, kuplank, kuplunk!"
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,6,She picked three more berries and ate them.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,7,Then she picked more berries and dropped one in the pail - kuplunk!
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,8,And the rest she ate.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,9,Then Little Sal ate all four blueberries out of her pail!
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,10,"Her mother walked slowly through the bushes, picking blueberries as she went and putting them in her pail."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,11,"Little Sal struggled along behind, picking blueberries and eating every single one."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,12,Little Sal hurried ahead and dropped a blueberry in her mother's pail.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,13,It didn't sound kuplink! because the bottom of the pail was already covered with berries.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,14,She reached down inside to get her berry back.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,15,"Though she really didn't mean to, she pulled out a large handful, because there were so many blueberries right up close to the one she had put in."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,16,"Her mother stopped picking and said, Now, Sal, you run along and pick your own berries."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,17,Mother wants to take her berries home and can them for next winter.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,18,"Her mother went back to her picking, but Little Sal, because her feet were tired of standing and walking, sat down in the middle of a large clump of bushes and ate blueberries."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,19,"On the other side of Blueberry Hill, Little Bear came with his mother to eat blueberries."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,20,"Little Bear, she said, eat lots of berries and grow big and fat."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,21,"We must store up food for the long, cold winter."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,22,Little Bear followed behind his mother as she walked slowly through the bushes eating berries.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,23,Little Bear stopped now and then to eat berries.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,24,Then he had to hustle along to catch up!
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,25,"Because his feet were tired of hustling, he picked out a large clump of bushes and sat down right in the middle and ate blueberries."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,26,"Over on the other side of the hill, Little Sal ate all of the berries she could reach from where she was sitting, then she started out to find her mother."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,27,"She heard a noise from around a rock and thought, That is my mother walking along!"
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,28,"But it was a mother crow and her children, and they stopped eating berries and flew away, saying Caw, Caw, Caw."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,29,"Then she heard another noise in the bushes and thought, That is surely my mother and I will go that way."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,30,But it was Little Bear's mother instead.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,31,"She was tramping along, eating berries, and thinking about storing up food for the winter."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,32,Little Sal tramped right along behind.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,33,"By this time, Little Bear had eaten all the berries he could reach without moving from his clump of bushes."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,34,Then he hustled off to catch up with his mother.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,35,He hunted and hunted but his mother was nowhere to be seen.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,36,"He heard a noise from over a stump and thought, That is my mother walking along."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,37,But it was a mother partridge and her children.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,38,"They stopped eating berries and hurried away. Then he heard a noise in the bushes and thought, That is surely my mother."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,39,"Then he heard a noise in the bushes and thought, That is surely my mother."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,40,I will hustle that way!
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,41,But it was Little Sal's mother instead!
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,42,"She was walking along, picking berries, and thinking about canning them for next winter."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,43,Little Bear hustled right along behind.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,44,Little Bear and Little Sal's mother and Little Sal and Little Bear's mother were all mixed up with each other among the blueberries on Blueberry Hill.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,45,"Little Bear's mother heard Sal walking along behind and thought it was Little Bear and she said, Little Bear, munch, munch, Eat all you -  gulp, can possibly hold! swallow."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,46,Little Sal said nothing.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,47,"She picked three berries and dropped them, kuplink, kuplank, kuplunk, in her small tin pail."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,48,Little Bear's mother turned around to see what on earth could make a noise like kuplunk!
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,49,"Grumph! she cried, choking on a mouthful of berries, This is not my child!"
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,50,Where is Little Bear?
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,51,She took one good look and backed away.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,52,"(She was old enough to be shy of people, even a very small person like Little Sal.)"
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,53,Then she turned around and walked off very fast to hunt for Little Bear.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,54,Little Sal's mother heard Little Bear tramping along behind and thought it was Little Sal.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,55,She kept right on picking and thinking about canning blueberries for next winter.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,56,Little Bear padded up and peeked into her pail.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,57,"Of course, he only wanted to taste a few of what was inside, but there were so many and they were so close together, that he tasted a Tremendous Mouthful by mistake."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,58,"Now, Sal, said Little Sal's mother without turning around, you run along and pick your own berries."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,59,Mother wants to can these for next winter.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,60,"Little Bear tasted another Tremendous Mouthful, and almost spilled the entire pail of blueberries!"
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,61,"Little Sal's mother turned around and gasped, My Goodness, you are not Little Sal!"
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,62,"Where, oh where, is my child?"
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,63,Little Bear just sat munching and munching and swallowing and licking his lips.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,64,Little Sal's mother slowly backed away.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,65,"(she was old enough to be shy of bears, even very small bears like Little Bear.)"
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,66,Then she turned and walked away quickly to look for Little Sal.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,67,She hadn't gone very far before she heard a kuplink! kuplank! kuplunk!
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,68,She knew just what made that kind of a noise!
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,69,Little Bear's mother had not hunted very long before she heard a hustling sound that stopped now and then to munch and swallow.
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,70,She knew just what made that kind of a noise!
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,71,"Little Bear and his mother went home down one side of Blueberry Hill, eating blueberries all the way, and full of food stored up for next winter."
M2,BLUEBERRIES FOR SAL,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,72,"And Little Sal and her mother went down the other side of Blueberry Hill, picking berries all the way, and drove home with food to can for next winter - a whole pail of blueberries and three more besides."

M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,1,We were all sitting around the big kitchen table.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,2,It was Saturday morning.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,3,Pancake morning.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,4,Mom was squeezing oranges for juice.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,5,Henry and I were betting on how many pancakes we each could eat.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,6,And grandpa was doing the flipping.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,7,"Seconds later, something flew through the air headed toward the kitchen ceiling . . . and landed right on Henry."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,8,"After we realized that the flying object was only a pancake, we all laughed, even Grandpa."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,9,Breakfast continued quite uneventfully.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,10,All the other pancakes landed in the pan.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,11,"And all of them were eaten, even the one that landed on Henry."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,12,"That night, touched off by the pancake incident at breakfast, Grandpa told us the best tall-tale bedtime story he'd ever told."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,13,"Across an ocean, over lots of huge bumpy mountains, across three hot deserts, and one smaller ocean . . . there lay the tiny town of Chewandswallow."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,14,"In most ways, it was very much like any other tiny town."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,15,"It had a Main Street lined with stores, houses with trees and gardens around them, a schoolhouse, about three hundred people, and some assorted cats and dogs."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,16,But there were no food stores in the town of Chewandswallow.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,17,They didn't need any.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,18,The sky supplied all the food they could possibly want.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,19,The only thing that was really different about Chewandswallow was its weather.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,20,"It came three times a day, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,21,Everything that everyone ate came from the sky.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,22,"Whatever the weather served, that was what they ate."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,23,But it never rained rain.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,24,It never snowed snow.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,25,And it never blew just wind.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,26,It rained things like soup and juice.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,27,It snowed mashed potatoes and green peas.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,28,And sometimes the wind blew in storms of hamburgers.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,29,The people could watch the weather report on television in the morning and they would even hear a prediction for the next day's food.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,30,"When the townspeople went outside, they carried their plates, cups, glasses, forks, spoons, knives and napkins with them."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,31,That way they would always be prepared for any kind of weather.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,32,"If there were leftovers, and there usually were, the people took them home and put them in their refrigerators in case they got hungry between meals."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,33,The menu varied.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,34,"By the time they woke up in the morning, breakfast was coming down."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,35,"After a brief shower of orange juice, low clouds of sunny-side up eggs moved in followed by pieces of toast."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,36,Butter and jelly sprinkled down for the toast.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,37,And most of the time it rained milk afterwards.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,38,"For lunch one day, frankfurters, already in their rolls, blew in from the northwest at about five miles an hour."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,39,There were mustard clouds nearby.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,40,Then the wind shifted to the east and brought in baked beans.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,41,A drizzle of soda finished off the meal.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,42,"Dinner one night consisted of lamb chops, becoming heavy at times, with occasional ketchup."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,43,"Periods of peas and baked potatoes were followed by gradual clearing, with a wonderful Jell-O setting in the west."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,44,The Sanitation Department of Chewandswallow had a rather unusual job for a sanitation department.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,45,It had to remove the goods that fell on the houses and sidewalks and lawns.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,46,The workers cleaned things up after every meal and fed all the dogs and cats.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,47,Then they emptied some of it into the surrounding oceans for the fish and turtles and whales to eat.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,48,The rest of the food was put back into the earth so that the soil would be richer for the people's flower gardens.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,49,Life for the townspeople was delicious until the weather took a turn for the worse.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,50,One day there was nothing but Gorgonzola cheese all day long.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,51,"The next day there was only broccoli, all overcooked."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,52,And the next day there were brussel sprouts and peanut butter with mayonnaise.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,53,Another day there was a pea soup fog.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,54,No one could see where they were going and they could barely find the rest of the meal that got stuck in the fog.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,55,"The food was getting larger and larger, and so were the portions."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,56,The people were getting frightened.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,57,Violent storms blew up frequently.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,58,Awful things were happening.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,59,One Tuesday there was a hurricane of bread and rolls all day long and into the night.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,60,"There were soft rolls and hard rolls, some with seeds and some without."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,61,There was white bread and rye and whole wheat toast.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,62,Most of it was larger than they had ever seen bread and rolls before.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,63,It was a terrible day.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,64,Everyone had to stay indoors.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,65,"Roofs were damaged, and the Sanitation Department was beside itself."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,66,"The mess took the workers four days to clean up, and the sea was full of floating rolls."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,67,"To help out, the people piled up as much bread as they could in their backyards."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,68,"The birds picked at it a bit, but it just stayed there and got staler and staler."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,69,There was a storm of pancakes one morning and a downpour of maple syrup that nearly flooded the town.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,70,A huge pancake covered the school.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,71,"No one could get it off because of its weight, so they had to close the school."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,72,Lunch one day brought fifteen-inch drifts of cream cheese and jelly sandwiches.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,73,Everyone ate themselves sick and the day ended with a stomachache.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,74,There was an awful salt and pepper wind accompanied by an even worse tornado.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,75,People were sneezing themselves silly and running to avoid the tomatoes.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,76,The town was a mess.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,77,There were seeds and pulp everywhere.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,78,The sanitation department gave up.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,79,The job was too big.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,80,Everyone feared for their lives.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,81,They couldn't go outside most of the time.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,82,"Many houses had been badly damaged by giant meatballs, stores were boarded up and there was no more school for the children."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,83,So a decision was made to abandon the town of Chewandswallow.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,84,It was a matter of survival.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,85,"The people glued together giant pieces of stale bread sandwich-style with peanut butter . . . took the absolute necessities with them, and set sail on their rafts for a new land."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,86,"After being afloat for a week, they finally reached a small coastal town, which welcomed them."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,87,"The bread had held up surprisingly well, well enough for them to build temporary houses for themselves out of it."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,88,"The children began school again, and the adults all tried to find places for themselves in the new land."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,89,The biggest change they had to make was getting used to buying food at a supermarket.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,90,"The found it odd that food was kept on shelves, packaged in boxes, cans and bottles."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,91,Meat that had to be cooked was kept in large refrigerators.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,92,Nothing came down from the sky except rain and snow.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,93,The clouds above their heads were not made of fried eggs.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,94,No one ever got hit by a hamburger again.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,95,And nobody dared to go back to Chewandswallow to find out what had happened to it.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,96,They were too afraid.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,97,Henry and I were awake until the very end of Grandpa's story.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,98,I remember his goodnight kiss.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,99,The next morning we woke up to see snow falling outside our window.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,100,We ran downstairs for breakfast and ate it a little faster than usual so we could go sledding with Grandpa.
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,101,"It's funny, but even as we were sliding down the hill we thought we saw a giant pat of butter at the top, and we could almost smell the mashed potatoes."
M5,CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS,JUDI BARRETT,102,The End
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,1,Corduroy is a bear who once lived in the toy department of a big store.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,2,Day after day he waited with all the other animals and dolls for somebody to come along and take him home.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,3,"The store was always filled with shoppers buying all sorts of things, but no one ever seemed to want a small bear in green overalls."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,4,Then one morning a little girl stopped and looked straight into Corduroy's bright eyes.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,5,"Oh, Mommy! she said."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,6,Look! There's the very bear I've always wanted.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,7,"Not today, dear."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,8,Her mother sighed.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,9,I've spent too much already.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,10,"Besides, he doesn't look new."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,11,He's lost the button to one of his shoulder straps.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,12,Corduroy watched them sadly as they walked away.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,13,"l didn't know I'd lost a button, he said to himself."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,14,Tonight I'll go and see if I can find it.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,15,"Late that evening, when all the shoppers had gone and the doors were shut and locked, Corduroy climbed carefully down from his shelf and began searching everywhere on the floor for his lost button."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,16,Suddenly he felt the floor moving under him!
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,17,Quite by accident he had stepped onto an escalator- and up he went!
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,18,Could this be a mountain? he wondered.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,19,I think I've always wanted to climb a mountain.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,20,He wandered around admiring the furniture.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,21,"This must be a bed, he said."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,22,I've always wanted to sleep in a bed.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,23,"And up he crawled onto a large, thick mattress."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,24,All at once he saw something small and round.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,25,"Why, here's my button! he cried."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,26,And he tried to pick it up.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,27,"But, like all the other buttons on the mattress, it was tied down tight."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,28,He yanked and pulled with both paws until pop!
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,29,"Off came the button - and off the mattress Corduroy toppled, bang into a tall floor lamp."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,30,Over it fell with a crash!
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,31,"Corduroy didn't know it, but there was someone else awake in the store."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,32,The night watchman was doing his rounds on the floor above.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,33,When he heard the crash he came dashing down the escalator.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,34,Now who in the world did that! he exclaimed.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,35,Somebody must be hiding around here!
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,36,He flashed his light under and over sofas and beds until he came to the biggest bed of all.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,37,And there he saw two fuzzy brown ears sticking up from under the cover.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,38,Hello! he said.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,39,How did you get upstairs?
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,40,The watchman tucked Corduroy under his arm and carried him down the escalator and set him on the shelf in the toy department with the other animals and dolls.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,41,Corduroy was just waking up when the first customers came into the store in the morning.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,42,"And there, looking at him with a wide, warm smile, was the same little girl he'd seen only the day before."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,43,"I'm Lisa, she said, and you're going to be my very own bear."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,44,Last night I counted what I've saved in my piggy bank and my mother said I could bring you home.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,45,Shall I put him in a box for you? the saleslady asked.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,46,"Oh, no thank you, Lisa answered."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,47,And she carried Corduroy home in her arms.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,48,"She ran all the way up four flights of stairs, into her family's apartment, and straight to her own room."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,49,Corduroy blinked.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,50,"There was a chair and a chest of drawers, and alongside a girl-size bed stood a little bed just the right size for him."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,51,"The room was small, nothing like that enormous palace in the department store."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,52,"This must be home, he said."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,53,I know I've always wanted a home!
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,54,Lisa sat down with Corduroy on her lap and began to sew a button on his overalls.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,55,"I like you the way you are, she said, but you'll be more comfortable with your shoulder strap fastened."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,56,"You must be a friend, said Corduroy."
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,57,I've always wanted a friend.
M6,CORDUROY,DON FREEMAN,58,"Me too! said Lisa, and gave him a big hug."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,1,This is George.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,2,He lived in Africa.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,3,He was a good little monkey and always very curious.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,4,One day George saw a man.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,5,He had on a large yellow straw hat.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,6,The man saw George too.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,7,"What a nice little monkey, he thought."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,8,I would like to take him home with me.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,9,"He put his hat on the ground and, of course, George was curious."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,10,He came down from the tree to look at the large yellow hat.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,11,The hat had been on the man's head.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,12,George thought it would be nice to have it on his own head.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,13,He picked it up and put it on.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,14,The hat covered George's head.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,15,He couldn't see.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,16,The man picked him up quickly and popped him into a bag.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,17,George was caught.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,18,"The man with the big yellow hat put George into a little boat, and a sailor rowed them both across the water to a big ship."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,19,"George was sad, but he was still a little curious."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,20,"On the big ship, things began to happen."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,21,The man took off the bag.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,22,"George sat on a little stool and the man said, George, I am going to take you to a big Zoo in a big city."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,23,You will like it there.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,24,"Now run along and Play, but don't get into trouble'"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,25,George promised to be good.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,26,But it is easy for little monkeys to forget.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,27,On the deck he found some sea gulls.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,28,He wondered how they could fly.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,29,He was very curious.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,30,Finally he HAD to try.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,31,It looked easy.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,32,But -
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,33,"oh, what happened!"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,34,First this - and then this!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,35,WHERE IS GEORGE?
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,36,The sailors looked and looked.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,37,"At last they saw him struggling in the water, and almost all tired out."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,38,Man overboard! the sailors cried as they threw him a lifebelt.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,39,George caught it and held on.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,40,At last he was safe on board.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,41,"After that George was more careful to be a good monkey, until, at last, the long trip was over."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,42,"George said good-bye to the kind sailors, and he and the man with the yellow hat walked off the ship on to the shore and on into the city to the man's house."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,43,After a good meal and a good pipe George felt very tired.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,44,He crawled into bed and fell asleep at once.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,45,The next morning the man telephoned the Zoo.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,46,George watched him.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,47,He was fascinated.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,48,Then the man went away.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,49,George was curious.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,50,"He wanted to telephone, too."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,51,"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,52,What fun!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,53,DING-A-LING-A-LING!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,54,GEORGE HAD TELEPHONED THE FIRE STATION!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,55,The firemen rushed to the telephone.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,56,Hello! Hello! they said.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,57,But there was no answer.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,58,Then they looked for the signal on the big map that showed where the telephone call had come from.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,59,They didn't know it was GEORGE.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,60,They thought it was a teal fire.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,61,Hurry!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,62,Hurry!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,63,Hurry!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,64,The firemen jumped on to the fire engines and on to the hook- and-ladders.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,65,Ding-dong-ding-dong.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,66,Everyone out of the way!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,67,Hurry!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,68,Hurry!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,69,Hurry!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,70,The firemen rushed into the house.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,71,They opened the door.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,72,NO FIRE!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,73,ONLY a naughty little monkey.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,74,"Oh, catch him, catch him, they cried."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,75,George tried to run away.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,76,"He almost did, but he got caught in the telephone wire, and – a thin fireman caught one arm and a fat fireman caught the other."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,77,"You fooled the fire department, they said."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,78,We will have to shut you up where you can't do any more harm.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,79,They took him away and shut him in a prison.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,80,George wanted to get out.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,81,He climbed up to the window to try the bars.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,82,Just then the watchman came in.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,83,He got on the wooden bed to catch George.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,84,But he was too big and heavy.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,85,"The bed tipped up, the watchman fell over, and, quick as lightning, George ran out through the open door."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,86,He hurried through the building and out on to the roof.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,87,And then he was lucky to be a monkey: out he walked on to the telephone wires.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,88,"Quickly and quietly over the guard's head, George walked away."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,89,He was free!
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,90,"Down in the street outside the Prison wall, stood a balloon man."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,91,A little girl bought a balloon for her brother.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,92,George watched.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,93,He was curious again.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,94,He felt he MUST have a bright red balloon.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,95,"He reached over and tried to help himself, but – instead of one balloon, the whole bunch broke loose."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,96,"In an instant the wind whisked them all away and, with them, went George, holding tight with both hands."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,97,"Up, up he sailed, higher and higher."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,98,The houses looked like toy houses and the people like dolls.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,99,George was frightened.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,100,He held on very tight.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,101,At first the wind blew in great gusts.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,102,Then it quieted.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,103,Finally it stopped blowing altogether.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,104,George was very tired.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,105,"Down, down he went - bump, on to the top of a traffic light."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,106,Everyone was surprised.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,107,The traffic got all mixed up.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,108,"George didn't know what to do, and then he heard someone call, GEORGE!"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,109,"He looked down and saw his friend, the man with the big yellow hat!"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,110,George was very happy.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,111,The man was happy roo.
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,112,"George slid down the post and the man with the big yellow hat put him under his arm, Then he paid the balloon man for all the balloons."
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,113,"And then George and the man climbed into the car and at last, away they went to the ZOO!"
M7,CURIOUS GEORGE,H.A. REY,114,What a nice place for George to live!
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,1,"A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,2,"And while she held him, she sang: I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,3,The baby grew.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,4,He grew and he grew and he grew.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,5,"He grew until he was two years old, and he ran all around the house."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,6,"He grew until he was two years old, and he ran all around the house."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,7,He pulled all the food out of the refrigerator and he took his mother's watch and flushed it down the toilet.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,8,"Sometimes his mother would say, This kid is driving me CRAZY!"
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,9,"But at night time, when that two-year old was quiet, she opened the door to his room, crawled across the floor, looked up over the side of his bed; and if he was really asleep she picked him up and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,10,"While she rocked him she sang: I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be."

M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,12,He grew and he grew and he grew.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,13,He grew until he was nine years old.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,14,"And he never wanted to come in for dinner, he never wanted to take a bath, and when grandma visited he always said bad words."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,15,Sometimes his mother wanted to sell him to the zoo!
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,16,"But at nighttime, when he was asleep, the mother quietly opened the door to his room, crawled across the floor and looked up over the side of the bed."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,17,"If he was really asleep, she picked up that nine-year-old boy and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,18,"And while she rocked him, she sang: I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,19,The boy grew.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,20,He grew and he grew and he grew.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,21,He grew until he was a teenager.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,22,He had strange friends and he wore strange clothes and he listened to strange music.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,23,Sometimes the mother felt like she was in a zoo!
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,24,"But at nighttime, when that teenager was asleep, the mother opened the door to his room, crawled across the floor and looked up over the side of the bed."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,25,"If he was really asleep she picked up that great big boy and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,26,"While she rocked him she sang: I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,27,That teenager grew.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,28,He grew and he grew and he grew.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,29,He grew until he was a grown-up man.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,30,He left home and got a house across town.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,31,But sometimes on dark nights the mother got into her car and drove across town.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,32,"If all the lights in her son's house were out, she opened his bedroom window, crawled across the floor, and looked up over the side of his bed."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,33,"If that great big man was really asleep she picked him up and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,34,"And while she rocked him she sang: I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,35,"Well, that mother, she got older."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,36,She got older and older and older.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,37,"One day she called up her son and said, You'd better come see me because I'm very old and sick."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,38,So her son came to see her.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,39,When he came in the door she tried to sing the song.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,40,She sang: I'll love you forever; I'll like you for always. . .
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,41,But she couldn't finish because she was too old and sick.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,42,The son went to his mother.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,43,"He picked her up and rocked her back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,44,"And he sang this song: I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my Mommy you'll be."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,45,"When the son came home that night, he stood for a long rime at the top of the stairs."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,46,Then he went into the room where his very new baby daughter was sleeping.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,47,"He picked her up in his arms and very slowly rocked her back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,48,And while he rocked her he sang.
M8,LOVE YOU FOREVER,ROBERT MUNSCH,49,"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be."
M9,THE CARROT SEED,RUTH KRAUSS,1,A little boy planted a carrot seed.
M9,THE CARROT SEED,RUTH KRAUSS,2,"His mother said, I'm afraid it won't come up."
M9,THE CARROT SEED,RUTH KRAUSS,3,"His father said, Im afraid it won't come up."

M9,THE CARROT SEED,RUTH KRAUSS,10,"Ande then one day, a carrot came up just as the little boy had known it would."
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,1,One winter morning Peter woke up and looked out the window.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,2,Snow had fallen during the night.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,3,It covered everything as far as he could see.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,4,After breakfast he put on his snowsuit and ran outside.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,5,The snow was piled up very high along the street to make a path for walking.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,6,"Crunch, crunch, crunch, his feet sank into the snow."
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,7,"He walked with his toes pointing out, like this:"
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,8,He walked with his toes pointing in like that:
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,9,Then he dragged his feet s-l-o-w-l-y to make tracks.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,10,And he found something sticking out of the snow that made a new track.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,11,I was a stick- a stick that was just right for smacking a snow-covered tree
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,12,Down fell the snow - plop! - on top of Peter's head.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,13,"He thought it would be fun to join the big boys in their snowball fight, but he knew he wasn't old enough- not yet."
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,14,So he made a smiling snowman and he made angels.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,15,He pretended he was a mountain-climber.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,16,He climbed up a great big tall heaping mound of snow- and slid all the way down.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,17,"He picked up a handful of snow- and another, and still another."
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,18,He packed it round and firm and put the snowball in his pocket for tomorrow.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,19,Then he went into his warm house.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,20,He told his mother all about his adventures while she took off his wet socks.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,21,And he thought and thought and thought about them.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,22,Before he got into bed he looked in his pocket.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,23,His pocket was empty.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,24,The snowball wasn't there.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,25,He felt very sad.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,26,"While he slept, he dreamed that the sun had melted all the snow away."
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,27,But when he woke up his dream was gone.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,28,The snow was still everywhere.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,29,New snow was falling.
M10,THE SNOWY DAY,EZRA JACK KEATS,30,"After breakfast he called to his friend from across the hall, and they went out together into the deep, deep snow."
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,1,Once there was a peddler who sold caps.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,2,But he was not like an ordinary peddler carrying his wares on his back.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,3,He carried them on top of his head.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,4,"First he had on his own checked cap, then a bunch of gray caps, then a bunch of brown caps, then a bunch of blue caps, and on the very top a bunch of red caps."
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,5,"He walked up and down the streets, holding himself very straight so as not to upset his caps."

M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,15,"He began to feel very hungry, but he had no money for lunch."
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,16,"I think I'll go for a walk in the country, said he."
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,17,"And he walked out of town - slowly, slowly, so as not to upset his caps."
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,18,He walked for a long time until he came to a great big tree.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,19,"That's a nice place for a rest, thought he."
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,20,"And he sat down very slowly, under the tree and leaned hack little by little against the tree-trunk so as not to disturb the caps on his head."
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,21,"Then he put up his hand to feel if they were straight - first his own checked cap, then the gray caps, then the brown caps, then the blue caps, then the red caps on the very top."
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,22,They were all there.

M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,25,When he woke up he was refreshed and rested.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,26,But before standing up he felt with his hand to make sure his caps were in the right place.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,27,All he felt was his own checked cap!
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,28,He looked to the right of him.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,29,No Caps.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,30,He looked to the left of him.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,31,No caps.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,32,He looked in back of him.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,33,No caps.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,34,He looked behind the tree.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,35,No caps.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,36,Then he looked up into the tree.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,37,And what do you think he saw?
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,38,On every branch sat a monkey.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,39,"On every monkey was a gray, or a brown, or a blue, or a red cap!"
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,40,The peddler looked at the monkeys.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,41,The monkeys looked at the peddler.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,42,He didn't know what to do.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,43,Finally he spoke to them.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,44,"You monkeys, you, he said, shaking a finger at them, you give me back my caps."
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,45,"But the monkeys only shook their fingers back at him and said, Tsz, tsz, tsz."
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,46,"This made the peddler angry, so he shook both hands at them and said, You monkeys, you!"
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,47,You give me back my caps.
M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,48,"But the monkeys only shook both their hands back at him and said, Tsz, tsz, tsz."

M11,CAPS FOR SALE,ESPHYR SLOBODKINA,51,You better give me back my caps!

M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,1,"Little Nutbrown Hare, who was going to bed, held on tight to Big Nutbrown Hare's very long ears."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,2,He wanted to be sure that Big Nutbrown Hare was listening.
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,3,"Guess how much I love you, he said."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,4,"Oh, I don't think I could guess that, said Big Nutbrown Hare."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,5,"This much, said Little Nutbrown Hare, stretching out his arms as wide as they could go."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,6,Big Nutbrown Hare had even longer arms.
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,7,"But I love you this much, he said."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,8,"Hmm, that is a lot, thought Little Nutbrown Hare."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,9,"I love you as high as I can reach, said Little Nutbrown Hare."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,10,"I love you as high as I can reach, said Big Nutbrown Hare."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,11,"That is very high thought Little Nutbrown Hare, I wish I had arms like that."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,12,Then Little Nutbrown Hare had a good idea.
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,13,He tumbled upside down and reached up the tree trunk with his feet.
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,14,I love you all the way up to my toes! he said.
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,15,"And, I love you all the way up to your toes, said Big Nutbrown Hare, swinging him up over his head."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,16,"I love you as high as I can hop! laughed Little Nutbrown Hare, bouncing up and down."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,17,"But I love you as high as I can hop, smiled Big Nutbrown Hare - and he hopped so high that his ears touched the branches above."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,18,"That's good hopping, thought Little Nutbrown Hare."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,19,I wish I could hop like that.
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,20,"I love you all the way down the lane as far as the river, cried Little Nutbrown Hare."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,21,"I love you across the river and over the hills, said Big Nutbrown Hare."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,22,"That's very far, thought Little Nutbrown Hare."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,23,He was almost too sleepy to think anymore.
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,24,"Then he looked beyond the thornbushes, out into the big dark night."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,25,Nothing could be farther than the sky.
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,26,"I love you right up to the moon he said, and closed his eyes."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,27,"Oh, that's far, said Big Nutbrown Hare."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,28,"That is very, very far."
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,29,Big Nutbrown Hare settled Little Nutbrown Hare into his bed of leaves.
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,30,He leaned over and kissed him good night.
M12,GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU,SAM MCBRATNEY,31,"Then he lay down close by and whispered with a smile, I love you right up to the moon and back."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,1,"One evening, after thinking it over for some time, Harold decided to go for, a walk in the moonlight."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,2,"There wasn't any moon, and Harold needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,3,And he needed something to walk on.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,4,He made a long straight path so he wouldn't get lost.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,5,"And he set off on his walk, taking his big purple crayon with him."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,6,But he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,7,So he left the path for a short cut across a field.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,8,And the moon went with him.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,9,The short cut led right to where Harold thought a forest ought to be.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,10,He didn't want to get lost in the woods.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,11,"So he made a very small forest, with just one tree in it."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,12,It turned out to be an apple tree.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,13,"The apples would be very tasty, Harold thought, when they got red."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,14,So he put a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,15,It was a terribly frightening dragon.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,16,It even frightened Harold.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,17,He backed away.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,18,His hand holding the purple crayon shook.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,19,Suddenly he realized what was happening.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,20,But by then Harold was over his head in an ocean.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,21,He came up thinking fast.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,22,And in no time he was climbing aboard a trim little boat.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,23,He quickly set sail.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,24,And the moon sailed along with him.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,25,"After he had sailed long enough, Harold made land without much trouble."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,26,"He stepped ashore on the beach, wondering where he was."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,27,The sandy beach reminded Harold of picnics.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,28,And the thought of picnics made him hungry.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,29,So he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,30,There was nothing but pie.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,31,But there were all nine kinds of pie that Harold liked best.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,32,When Harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,33,He hated to see so much delicious pie go to waste.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,34,So Harold left a very hungry moose and a deserving porcupine to finish it up.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,35,"And, off he went, looking for a hill to climb, to see where he was."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,36,Harold knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,37,So he decided to make the hill into a mountain.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,38,"If he went high enough, he thought, he could see the window of his bedroom."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,39,He was tired and he felt he ought to be getting to bed.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,40,He hoped he could see his bedroom window from the top of the mountain.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,41,But as he looked down over the other side he slipped –
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,42,And there wasn't any other side of the mountain.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,43,"He was falling, in thin air."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,44,"But, luckily, he kept his wits and his purple crayon."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,45,He made a balloon and he grabbed on to it.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,46,And he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,47,He had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn't see his window.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,48,He couldn't even see a house.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,49,"So he made a house, with windows."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,50,And he landed the balloon on the grass in the front yard.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,51,None of the windows was his window.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,52,He tried to think where his window ought to be.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,53,He made some more windows.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,54,He made a big building full of windows.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,55,He made lots of building full of windows.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,56,He made a whole city full of windows.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,57,But none of the windows was his window.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,58,He couldn't think where it might be.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,59,He decided to ask a policeman.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,60,The policeman pointed the way Harold was going anyway.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,61,But Harold thanked him.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,62,"And he walked along with the moon, wishing he was in his room and in bed."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,63,"Then, suddenly, Harold remembered."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,64,"He remembered where his bedroom window was, when there was a moon."
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,65,It was always right around the moon.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,66,And then Harold made his bed.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,67,He got in it and drew up the covers.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,68,The purple crayon dropped on the floor. And Harold dropped off to sleep.
M13,HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON,CROCKETT JOHNSON,69,And Harold dropped off to sleep.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,1,"When my Great Gramma Anna came to America, she wore the same thick overcoat and big boots he had worn for farm work."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,2,But her family weren't dirt farmers anymore.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,3,"In New York City her father's work was hauling things on a wagon, and the rest of the family made artificial flowers all day."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,4,"Everyone was in a hurry, and it was so crowded, not like in backhome Russia."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,5,"But all the same it was their home, and most of their neighbors were just like them."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,6,"When Anna went to school, English sounded to her like pebbles dropping into shallow water."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,7,Shhhhhh.. . .  Shhhhhh.. . .  Shhhhhh.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,8,In six months she was speaking English.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,9,"Her parents almost never learned, so she spoke English for them, too."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,10,The only things she had left of backhome Russia were her dress and the babushka she liked to throw up into the air when she was dancing.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,11,And her dress was getting too small.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,12,"After her mother had sewn her a new one, she took her old dress and babushka."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,13,"Then from a basket of old clothes she took Uncle Vladimir's shirt, Aunt Havalah's nightdress, and an apron of Aunt Natasha's."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,14,"We will make a quilt to help us always remember home, Anna's mother said."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,15,It will be like having the family in backhome Russia dance around us at night.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,16,And so it was.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,17,Anna's mother invited all the neighborhood ladies.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,18,They cut out animals and flowers from the scraps of clothing.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,19,Anna kept the needles threaded and handed them to the ladies as they needed them.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,20,The border of the quilt was made of Anna's babushka.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,21,On Friday nights Anna's mother would say the prayers that started the Sabbath.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,22,The family ate challah and chicken soup.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,23,The quilt was the tablecloth.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,24,Anna grew up and fell in love with Great-Grandpa Sasha.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,25,"To show he wanted to be her husband, he gave Anna a gold coin, a dried flower, and a piece of rock salt, all tied into a linen handkerchief."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,26,"The gold was for wealth, the flower for love, and the salt so their lives would have flavor."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,27,She accepted the hankie.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,28,They were engaged.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,29,"Under the wedding huppa, Anna and Sasha promised each other love and understanding."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,30,"After the wedding, the men and women celebrated separately."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,31,"When my Grandma Carle was born, Anna wrapped her daughter in the quilt to welcome her warmly into the world."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,32,"Carle was given a gift of gold, flower, salt, and bread."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,33,"Gold so she would never know poverty, a flower so she would always know love, salt so her life would always have flavor, and bread so that she would never know hunger."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,34,Carle learned to keep the Sabbath and to cook and clean and do washing.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,35,"Married you'll be someday, Anna told Carle, and. . ."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,36,"again the quilt became a wedding huppa, this time for Carle's wedding to Grandpa George."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,37,"Men and women celebrated together, but they still did not dance together."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,38,"In Carle's wedding bouquet was a gold coin, bread, and salt."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,39,Carle and George moved to a farm in Michigan and Great-Gramma Anna came to live with them.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,40,"The quilt once again wrapped a new little girl, Mary Ellen."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,41,"Mary Ellen called Anna, Lady Gramma."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,42,She had grown very old and was sick a lot of the time.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,43,The quilt kept her legs warm.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,44,"On Anna's ninety-eighth birthday, the cake was a kulich, a rich cake with raisins and candied fruit in it."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,45,"When Great-Gramma Anna died, prayers were said to lift her soul to heaven."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,46,My mother Mary Ellen was now grown up.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,47,"When Mary Ellen left home, she took the quilt with her."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,48,"When she became a bride, the quilt became her huppa."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,49,"For the first time, friends who were not Jews came to the wedding."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,50,"My mother wore a suit, but in her bouquet were gold, bread, and salt."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,51,"The quilt, welcomed me, Patricia, into the world. . ."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,52,And it was the tablecloth for my first birthday party.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,53,At night I would trace my fingers around the edges of each animal on the quilt before I went to sleep.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,54,I told my mother stories about the animals on the quilt.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,55,"She told me whose sleeve had made the horse, whose"
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,56,"apron had made the chicken, whose dress had made the flowers and whose babushka went around the edge of the quilt."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,57,"The quilt was a pretend cape when I was in the bullring, or sometimes a tent in the steaming Amazon jungle."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,58,"At my wedding to Enzo-Mario, men and women danced together."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,59,"In my bouquet were gold, bread, and salt-and a sprinkle of wine, so I would always know laughter."
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,60,Twenty years ago I held Traci Denise in the quilt for the first time.
M14,THE KEEPING QUILT,PATRICIA POLACCO,61,"Someday she, too, will leave home and she will take the quilt with her."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,1,That summer the fence that stretched through our town seemed bigger.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,2,We lived in a yellow house on one side of it.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,3,White people lived on the other.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,4,"And Mama said, Don't climb over that fence when you play."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,5,She said it wasn't safe.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,6,That summer there was a girl who wore a pink sweater.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,7,Each morning she climbed up on the fence and stared over at our side.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,8,Sometimes I stared back.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,9,"She never sat on that fence with anybody, that girl didn't."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,10,"Once, when we were jumping rope, she asked if she could play."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,11,And my friend Sandra said no without even asking the rest of us.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,12,I don't know what I would have said.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,13,Maybe yes.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,14,Maybe no.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,15,That summer everyone and everything on the other side of that fence seemed far away.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,16,"When I asked my mama why, she said, Because that's the way things have always been."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,17,"Sometimes when me and Mama went into town, I saw that girl with her mama."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,18,"She looked sad sometimes, that girl did."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,19,"Don't stare, my mama said. It's not polite."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,20,It rained a lot that summer.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,21,On rainy days that girl sat on the fence in a raincoat.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,22,She let herself get all wet and acted like she didn't even care.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,23,"Sometimes I saw her dancing around in puddles, splashing and laughing."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,24,Mama wouldn't let me go out in the rain.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,25,"That's why I bought you rainy-day toys, my mama said."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,26,You stay inside here-where it's warm and safe and dry.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,27,"But every time it rained, I looked for that girl."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,28,And I always found her.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,29,Somewhere near the fence.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,30,"Someplace in the middle of the summer, the rain stopped."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,31,"When I walked outside, the grass was damp and the sun was already high up in the sky."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,32,And I stood there with my hands up in the air.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,33,I felt brave that day.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,34,I felt free.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,35,I got close to the fence and that girl asked me my name.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,36,Clover I said.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,37,"My name's Annie, she said."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,38,Annie Paul.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,39,"I live over yonder, she said, by where you see the laundry."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,40,That's my blouse hanging on the line.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,41,She smiled then.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,42,She had a pretty smile.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,43,"And then I smiled. And we stood there looking at each other, smiling."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,44,"lt's nice up on this fence, Annie said."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,45,You can see all over.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,46,I ran my hand along the fence.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,47,I reached up and touched the top of it.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,48,"A fence like this was made for sitting on, Annie said."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,49,She looked at me sideways.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,50,"My mama Says I shouldn't go on the other side, I said."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,51,My mama says the same thing. But she never said nothing about sitting on it.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,52,"Neither did mine, I said."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,53,That summer me and Annie sat together on that fence.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,54,"And when Sandra and them looked at me funny, I just made believe I didn't care."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,55,Some mornings my mama watched us.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,56,I waited for her to tell me to get down from that fence before I break my neck or something.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,57,But she never did.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,58,"l see you made a new friend, she said one morning."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,59,And I nodded and Mama smiled.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,60,That summer me and Annie sat on that fence and watched the whole wide world around us.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,61,One day Sandra and them were jumping rope near the fence and we asked if we could play.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,62,"I don't care, Sandra said."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,63,"And when we jumped, Sandra and me were partners, the way we used to be."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,64,"When we were too tired to jump anymore, we sat up on the fence, all of us in a long line."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,65,"Someday somebody's going to come along and knock this old fence down, Annie said."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,66,And I nodded.
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,67,"Yeah, I said."
M15,THE OTHER SIDE,JACQUELINE WOODSON,68,Someday.

M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,1,In an old house in Paris that was covered with vines lived twelve little girls in two straight lines.
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,2,In two straight lines they broke their bread and brushed their teeth and went to bed.
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,3,The smiled at the good and frowned at the bad and sometimes they were very sad.
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,4,The left the house at half past nine in two straight lines in rain or shine - the smallest one was Madeline.
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,5,"She was not afraid of mice - she loved winter, snow, and ice."
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,6,"To the tiger at the zoo Madeline just said, Pooh-pooh, and nobody knew so well how to frighten Miss Clavel."
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,7,"In the middle of one night Miss Clavel turned on her light and said, Something is not right!"
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,8,"Little Madeline sat in bed, cried and cried; her eyes were red."
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,9,"And soon after Dr. Cohn came, he rushed out to the phone and he dialed: DANton-tex-six - Nurse, he said, it's an appendix!"
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,10,Everybody had to cry - not a single eye was dry.
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,11,Madeline was in his arm in a blanket safe and warm.
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,12,In a car with a red light they drove into the night.
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,13,"Madeline woke up two hours later, in a room with flowers."
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,14,Madeline soon ate and drank.
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,15,"On her bed there was a crank, and a crack on the ceiling had the habit of sometimes looking like a rabbit."
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,16,"Outside were birds, trees, and sky - and so ten days passed quickly by."
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,17,one nice morning Miss Clavel said - Isn't this a fine - day to visit Madeline.
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,18,VISITORS FROM TWO TO FOUR read a sign outside her door.
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,19,"Tiptoeing with solemn face, with some flowers and a vase, in they walked then said, Ahhh, when they saw the toys and candy and the dollhouse from Papa."
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,20,But the biggest surprise by far - on her stomach was a scar!
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,21,"Good-by, they said, we'll come again, and the little girls left in the rain."
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,22,They went home and broke their bread brushed their teeth and went to bed.
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,23,"In the middle of the night Miss Clavel turned on the light and said, Something is not right!"
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,24,"And afraid of a disaster Miss Clavel ran fast and faster, and she said, Please children do - tell me what is troubling you?"
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,25,"And all the little girls cried, Boohoo, we want our appendix out, too!"
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,26,"Good night, little girls!"
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,27,Thank the lord you are well!
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,28,And now go to sleep! said Miss Clavel.
M17,MADELINE,LUDWIG BEMELMANS,29,And she turned out the light - and closed the door - and that's all there is - there isn't any more.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,1,Mr. and Mrs. Mallard were looking for a place to live.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,2,"But every time Mr. Mallard saw what looked like a nice place, Mrs. Mallard said it was no good."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,3,"There was sure to be foxes in the woods or turtles in the water, and she was not going to raise a family where there might be foxes or turtles."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,4,So the flew on and on.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,5,"When they got to Boston, they felt too tired to fly any further."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,6,"There was a nice pond in the Public Garden, with a little island on it."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,7,"The very place to spend the night, quacked Mr. Mallard."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,8,So down they flapped.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,9,Next morning they fished for their breakfast in the mud at the bottom on the pond.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,10,But they didn't find much.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,11,"Just as they were getting ready to start on their way, a strange enormous bird came by."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,12,"It was pushing a boat full of people, and there was a man sitting on its back."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,13,"Good morning, quacked Mr. Mallard, being polite."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,14,The big bird was too proud to answer.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,15,"But the people on the boat threw peanuts into the water, so the Mallards followed them all round the pond and got another breakfast, better than the first."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,16,"I like this place, said Mrs. Mallard as they climbed out on the bank and waddled along."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,17,Why don't we build a nest and raise our ducklings right in this pond?
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,18,"There are no foxes and no turtles, and the people feed us peanuts."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,19,What could be better?
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,20,"Good, said Mr. Mallard, delighted that at last Mrs. Mallard had found a place that suited her."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,21,"But – Look out! squawked Mrs. Mallard, all of a dither."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,22,You'll get run over!
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,23,"And when she got her breath she added: This is no place for babies, with all those horrid things rushing about."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,24,We'll have to look somewhere else.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,25,"So they flew over Beacon Hill and round the State House, but there was no place there."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,26,"They looked in Louisburg Square, but there as no water to swim in."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,27,Then they flew over the Charles River.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,28,"This is better, quacked Mr. Mallard."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,29,"That island looks like a nice quiet place, and it's only a little way from the Public Garden."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,30,"Yes, said Mrs. Mallard, remembering the peanuts."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,31,That looks like just the right place to hatch ducklings.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,32,So they chose a cozy spot among the bushes near the water and settled down to build their nest.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,33,"And only just in time, for now they were beginning to molt."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,34,"All their old wing feathers started to drop out, and they would not be able to fly again until the new ones grew in."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,35,"But of course they could swim, and one day they swam over to the park on the river bank, and they met a policeman called Michael."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,36,"Michael fed them peanuts, and after that the Mallards called on Michael every day."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,37,"After Mrs. Mallard had laid eight eggs in the nest she couldn't go visit Michael any more, because she had to sit on the eggs and keep them warm."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,38,"She moved off the nest only to get a drink of water, or to have her lunch, or to count the eggs and make sure they were all there."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,39,One day the ducklings hatched out.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,40,"First came Jack, then Kack, and then Lack, then Mack and Nack and Ouach and Pack and Quack."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,41,Mr. and Mrs. Mallard were bursting with price.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,42,"It was a great responsibility taking care of so many ducklings, and it kept them very busy."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,43,"One day Mr. Mallard decided he'd like to take a trip to see what the rest of the river was like, further on."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,44,So off he set.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,45,"I'll meet you in a week, in the Public Garden, he quacked over his shoulder."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,46,Take care of the ducklings.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,47,"Don't you worry, said Mrs. Mallard."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,48,I know all about bringing up children.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,49,And she did.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,50,She taught them how to swim and dive.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,51,"She taught them to walk in a line, to come when they were called, and to keep a safe distance from bikes and scooters and other things with wheels."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,52,"When at last she felt perfectly satisfied with them, she said one morning: Come along children."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,53,Follow me.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,54,"Before you could wink and eyelash, Jack, Kack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack and Quack fell into line, just as they had been taught."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,55,Mrs. Mallard led the way into the water and they swam behind her to the opposite bank.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,56,There they waded ashore and waddled along till they came to the highway.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,57,Mrs. Mallard stepped out to cross the road.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,58,"Honk, honk! went the horns on the speeding cars."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,59,Qua-a-ack! went Mrs. Mallard as she tumbled back again.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,60,"Quack! Quack! Quack! Quack! went Jack, Kack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack and Quack, just as loud as their little quackers could quack."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,61,"The cars kept speeding by and honking, and Mrs. Mallard and the ducklings kept right on quack-quack-quacking."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,62,"They made such a noise that Michael came running, waving his arms and blowing his whistle."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,63,"He planted himself in the center of the road, raised one hand to stop the traffic, and then beckoned with the other, the way policemen do, for Mrs. Mallard to cross over."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,64,"As soon as Mrs. Mallard and the ducklings were safe on the other side and on their way down Mount Vernon Street, Michael rushed back to his police booth."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,65,He called Clancy at headquarters and said: There's a family of ducks walkin' down the street!
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,66,Clancy said: Family of what?
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,67,Ducks! yelled Michael.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,68,"Send a police car, quick!"
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,69,"Meanwhile, Mrs. Mallard had reached the Corner Book Shop and turned into Charles Street, with Jack, Kack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack and Quack all marching in line behind her."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,70,Everyone stared.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,71,"An old lady from Beacon Hill said: Isn't it amazing! and a man who swept the streets said: Well, now, ain't that nice! and when Mrs. Mallard heard them she was so proud she tipped her nose in the air and walked along with and extra swing in her waddle."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,72,"When they came to the corner of Beacon Street, there was the police car with four policemen that Clancy had sent from headquarters."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,73,"The policemen held back the traffic so Mrs. Mallard and the ducklings could march across the street, right on into the Public Garden."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,74,Inside the gate they all turned round to say thank you to the policemen.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,75,The policemen smiled and waved good-by.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,76,"When they reached the pond and swam across to the little island, there was Mr. Mallard waiting for them, just as he had promised."
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,77,The ducklings liked the new island so much that they decided to live there.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,78,All day long they follow the swan boats and eat peanuts.
M18,MAKE WAY FOR DUCKLINGS,ROBERT MCCLOSKEY,79,And when night falls they swim to their little island and go to sleep.

M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,1,"It was late one winter night, long past my bedtime, when Pa and I went owling."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,2,There was no wind.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,3,The trees stood still as giant statues.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,4,And the moon was so bright the sky seemed to shine.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,5,"Somewhere behind us a train whistle blew, long and low, like a sad, sad song."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,6,I could hear it through the woolen cap Pa had pulled down over my ears.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,7,"A farm dog answered the train, and then a second dog joined in."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,8,"They sang out, trains and dogs, for a real long time."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,9,And when their voices faded away it was as quiet as a dream.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,10,"We walked on toward to woods, Pa and I."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,11,Our feet crunched over the crisp snow and little gray footprints followed us.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,12,"Pa made a long shadow, but mine was short and round."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,13,"I had to run after him every now and then to keep up, and my short, round shadow bumped after me."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,14,But I never called out.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,15,"If you go owling you have to be quiet, that's what Pa always says."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,16,"I had been waiting to go owling with Pa for a long, long time."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,17,"We reached the line of pine trees, black and pointy against the sky, and Pa held up his hand."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,18,I stopped right where I was and waited.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,19,"He looked up, as if searching the stars, as if reading a map up there."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,20,The moon made his face into a silver mask.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,21,"Then he called: Whoo-whoo-who-who-who-whoooooooo, the sound of a Great Horned Owl."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,22,Whoo-whoo-who-who-who-whoooooooo.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,23,Again he called out.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,24,And then again.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,25,After each call he was silent and for a moment we both listened.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,26,But there was no answer.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,27,Pa shrugged and I shrugged.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,28,I was not disappointed.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,29,My brothers all said sometimes there's an owl and sometimes there isn't.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,30,We walked on.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,31,"I could feel the cold, as if someone's icy hand was palm-down on my back."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,32,And my nose and the tops of my cheeks felt cold and hot at the same time.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,33,But I never said a word.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,34,"If you go owling, you have to be quiet and make your own heat."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,35,We went into the woods.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,36,The shadows were the blackest things I had ever seen.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,37,They stained the white snow.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,38,"My mouth felt furry, for the scarf over it was wet and warm."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,39,I didn't ask what kinds of things hide behind black trees in the middle of the night.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,40,When you go owling you have to be brave.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,41,Then we came to a clearing in the dark woods.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,42,The moon was high above us.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,43,It seemed to fit exactly over the center of the clearing and the snow below it was whiter than the milk in a cereal bowl.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,44,I sighed and Pa held up his hand at the sound.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,45,I put my mittens over the scarf over my mouth and listened hard.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,46,And then Pa called: Whoo-whoo-who-who-who-whoooooooo. Whoo-whoo-who-who-who-whoooooooo.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,47,I listened and looked so hard my ears hurt and my eyes got cloudy with the cold.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,48,"Pa raised his face to call out again, but before he could open his mouth an echo came threading its way through the trees."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,49,Whoo-whoo-who-who-who-whoooooooo.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,50,Pa almost smiled.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,51,"Then he called back: Whoo-whoo-who-who-who-whoooooooo, just as if he and the owl were talking about supper or about the woods or the moon or the cold."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,52,"I took my mitten off the scarf off my mouth, and I almost smiled, too."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,53,"The owl's call came closer, from high up in the trees on the edge of the meadow."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,54,Nothing in the meadow moved.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,55,"All of a sudden an owl shadow, part of the big tree shadow, lifted off and flew right over us."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,56,"We watched silently with the heat of our mouths, the heat of all those words we had not spoken."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,57,The shadow hooted again.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,58,Pa turned on his big flashlight and caught the owl just as it was landing on a branch.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,59,"For one minute, three minutes, maybe even a hundred minutes, we stared at one another."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,60,Then the owl pumped its great wings and lifted off the branch like a shadow without sound.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,61,It flew back into the forest.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,62,"Time to go home, Pa said to me."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,63,"I knew then I could talk, I could even laugh out loud."
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,64,But I was a shadow as we walked home.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,65,When you go owling you don't need words or warm or anything but hope.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,66,That's what Pa says.
M20,OWL MOON,JANE YOLEN,67,The kind of hope that flies on silent wings under a shining Owl Moon.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,1,"In a warm and sultry forest far, far away, there once lived a mother fruit bat and her new baby."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,2,"Oh, how Mother Bat loved her soft tiny baby."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,3,"I'll name you Stellaluna, she crooned."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,4,"Each night, Mother Bat would carry Stellaluna clutched to her breast as she flew out to search for food."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,5,"One night, as Mother Bat followed the heavy scent of ripe fruit, an owl spied her."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,6,On silent wings the powerful bird swooped down upon the bats.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,7,"Dodging and shrieking, Mother Bat tried to escape, but the owl struck again and again, knocking Stellaluna into the air."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,8,Her baby wings were as limp and useless as wet paper.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,9,"Down, down she went, faster and faster, into the forest below."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,10,The dark leafy tangle of branches caught Stellaluna as she fell.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,11,One twig was small enough for Stellaluna's tiny feet.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,12,"Wrapping her wings about her, she clutched the thin branch, trembling with cold and fear."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,13,"Mother, Stellaluna squeaked."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,14,Where are you?
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,15,"By drybreak, the baby bat could hold on no longer."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,16,"Down, down again she dropped."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,17,Flump!
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,18,"Stellaluna landed headfirst in a soft downy nest, startling the three baby birds who lived there."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,19,Stellaluna quickly clambered from the nest and hung out of sight below it.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,20,She listened to the babble of the three birds.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,21,What was that? cried Flap.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,22,"I don't know but it's hanging by its feet, chirped Flitter."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,23,"Shhh! Here comes Mama, hissed Pip."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,24,"Many, many times that day Mama Bird flew away, always returning with food for her babies."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,25,Stellaluna was terribly hungry- but not for the crawly things Mama Bird brought.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,26,"Finally, though, the little bat could bear it no longer."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,27,"She climbed into the nest, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,28,Plop!
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,29,In dropped a big green grasshopper!
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,30,Stellaluna learned to be like the birds.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,31,She stayed awake all day and slept at night.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,32,She ate bugs even though they tasted awful.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,33,Her bat ways were quickly disappearing.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,34,Except for one thing: Stellaluna still liked to sleep hanging by her feet.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,35,"Once, when Mama was away, the curious baby birds decided to try it, too."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,36,When Mama Bird came home she saw eight tiny feet gripping the edge of the nest.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,37,Eeeek! she cried.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,38,Get back up here this instant!
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,39,You're going to fall and break your necks!
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,40,"The birds clambered back into the nest, but Mama Bird stopped Stellaluna."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,41,You are teaching my children to do bad things.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,42,I will not let you back into this nest unless you promise to obey all the rules of this house.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,43,Stellaluna promised.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,44,She ate bugs without making faces.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,45,She slept in the nest at night.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,46,And she didn't hang by her feet.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,47,Stellaluna behaved as a good bird should.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,48,All the babies grew quickly.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,49,Soon the nest became crowded.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,50,Mama Bird told them it was time to learn to fly.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,51,"One by one, Pip, Flitter, Flap, and Stellaluna jumped from the nest."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,52,Their wings worked!
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,53,"I'm just like them, thought Stellaluna."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,54,"I can fly, too."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,55,"Pip, Flitter, and Flap landed gracefully on a branch."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,56,Stellaluna tried to do the same.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,57,How embarrassing!
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,58,"I will fly all day, Stellaluna told herself."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,59,Then no one will see how clumsy I am.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,60,"The next day, Pip, Flitter, Flap, and Stellaluna went flying far from home."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,61,"They flew for hours, exercising their new wings."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,62,"The sun is setting, warned Flitter."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,63,"We had better go home or we will get lost in the dark, said Flap."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,64,But Stellaluna had flown far ahead and was nowhere to be seen.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,65,The three anxious birds went home without her.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,66,All alone Stellaluna flew and flew until her wings ached and she dropped into a tree.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,67,"I promised not to hang by my feet, Stellaluna sighed."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,68,So she hung by her thumbs and soon fell asleep.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,69,She didn't hear the soft sound of wings coming near.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,70,Hey! a loud voice said.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,71,Why are you hanging upside down?
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,72,Stellaluna's eyes opened wide.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,73,She saw a most peculiar face.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,74,"I'm not upside down, you are! Stellaluna said."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,75,"Ah, but you're a bat."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,76,Bats hang by their feet.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,77,"You are hanging by your thumbs, so that makes you upside down!the creature said."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,78,I'm a bat.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,79,I am hanging by my feet.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,80,That makes me right side up!
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,81,Stellaluna was confused.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,82,Mama Bird told me I was upside down.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,83,She said I was wrong . . .
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,84,"Wrong for a bird, maybe, but not for a bat."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,85,More bats gathered around to see the strange young bat who behaved like a bird.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,86,Stellaluna told them her story.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,87,You ate b-bugs? stuttered one.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,88,You slept at night? gasped another.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,89,"How very strange, they all murmured."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,90,Wait! Wait! Let me look at this child.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,91,A bat pushed through the crowd.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,92,An owl attacked you? she asked.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,93,"Sniffing Stellaluna's fur, she whispered, You are Stellaluna."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,94,You are my baby.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,95,You escaped the owl? cried Stellaluna.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,96,You survived?
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,97,"Yes, said Mother Bat as she wrapped her wings around Stellaluna. Come with me and I'll show you where to find the most delicious fruit."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,98,You'll  never have to eat another bug as long as you live.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,99,"But it's nighttime, Stellaluna squeaked."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,100,We can't fly in the dark or we will crash into trees.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,101,"We're bats, said Mother Bat."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,102,We can see in darkness.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,103,Come with us.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,104,"Stellaluna was afraid, but she let go of the tree and dropped into the deep blue sky."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,105,Stellaluna could see.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,106,She felt as though rays of light shone from her eyes.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,107,She was able to see everything in her path.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,108,Soon the bats found a mango tree and stellaluna ate as much of the fruit as she could hold.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,109,"I'll never eat another bug as long as I live, cheered Stellaluna as she stuffed herself full."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,110,"I must tell Pip, Flitter and Flap!"
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,111,The next day Stellaluna went to visit the birds.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,112,"Come with me and meet my bat family, said Stellaluna."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,113,"Okay, let's go, agreed Pip."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,114,"They hang by their feet and they fly at night and they eat the best food in the world, Stellaluna explained to the birds on the way."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,115,"As the birds flew among the bats, Flap said, I feel upside down here."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,116,So the birds hung by their feet.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,117,"Wait until dark, Stellaluna said excitedly."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,118,We will fly at night.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,119,When night came Stellaluna flew away.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,120,"Pip, Flitter, and Flap leapt from the tree to follow her."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,121,I can't see a thing! yelled Pip.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,122,"Neither can I, howled Flitter."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,123,Aaeee! shrieked Flap.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,124,"They're going to crash, gasped Stellaluna."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,125,I must rescue them!
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,126,"Stellaluna swooped about, grabbing her friends in the air."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,127,"She lifted them to a tree, and the birds grasped a branch."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,128,Stellaluna hung from the limb above them.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,129,"We're safe, said Stellaluna."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,130,"Then she sighed. I wish you could see in the dark, too."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,131,"We wish you could land on your feet, Flitter replied."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,132,Pip and Flap nodded.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,133,They perched in silence for a long time.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,134,How can we be so different and feel so much alike? mused Flitter.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,135,And how can we feel so different and be so much alike? wondered Pip.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,136,I think this is quite a mystery Flap chirped.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,137,"I agree, said Stellaluna. But we're friends."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,138,And that's a fact.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,139,BAT NOTES
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,140,"Of the nearly 4,000 species of mammals on Earth, almost one quarter are bats, the only mammals capable of powered flight."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,141,"The scientific name for bats in Chiroptera, hand-wing, because the skeleton that supports the wing is composed on the animal's elongated finger bones."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,142,"The majority of bats are classified as Microchiroptera, small hand-wing."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,143,Nearly 800 varieties fill special niches in every climate around the world except the polar zones.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,144,The lifestyles and food preferences of Microchiroptera vary wildly.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,145,"Many eat insects, while others catch fish, amphibians, and reptiles."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,146,"Finally, there is the famous vampire, of which there are only three species, ranging from Mexico to Argentina."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,147,The vampire's victims are mostly domestic cattle and native mammals and birds.
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,148,"The other 170 or so species of bats are the fruit bats, otherwise known as Megachiroptera, or large hand-wing."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,149,"As their name implies, they are the largest bats, some types boasting wingspans of six feet."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,150,"Fruit bats generally have long muzzles, large eyes, pointy ears, and furry bodies, which is why they are often called flying foxes."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,151,"Unlike Microchiroptera, who travel by echolocation, fruit bats depend on their keen vision and sense of smell to navigate."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,152,"They live in tropical and subtropical climates that provide year-round supplies of their favorite fruit, flowers, and nectar."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,153,"Some fruit bats, as they forage for nectar, are responsible for pollination of many types of night-blooming trees and plants."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,154,"Others eat whole fruits, seeds and all, and distribute the seeds over the forest floor in their droppings."
M21,STELLALUNA,JANELL CANNON,155,Regeneration of tropical forests depends greatly on bats.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,1,Sylvester Duncan lived with his mother and father at Acorn Road in Oatsdale.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,2,One of his hobbies was collecting pebbles of unusual shape and color.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,3,"On a rainy Saturday, during vacation he found a quite extraordinary one."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,4,"It was flaming red, shiny, and perfectly round, like a marble."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,5,"As he was studying this remarkable pebble, he began to shiver, probably from excitement, and the rain felt cold on his back."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,6,"I wish it would stop raining, he said."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,7,To his great surprise the rain stopped.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,8,It didn't stop gradually as rains usually do.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,9,It CEASED.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,10,"The drops vanished on the way down, the clouds disappeared, everything was dry, and the sun was shining as if rain had never existed."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,11,In all his young life Sylvester had never had a wish gratified so quickly.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,12,"It struck him that magic must be at work, and he guessed that the magic must be in the remarkable-looking red pebble."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,13,(Where indeed it was.)
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,14,"To make a test, he put the pebble on the ground and said, I wish it would rain again."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,15,Nothing happened.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,16,"But when he said the same thing holding the Pebble in his hoof, the sky turned black, there was lightning and a clap of thunder, and the rain came shooting down."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,17,What a lucky day this is! thought Sylvester.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,18,From now on I can have anything I want.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,19,My father and mother can have anything they want.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,20,"My relatives, my friends, and anybody at all can have everything anybody wants!"
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,21,"He wished the sunshine back in the sky, and he wished a wart on his left hind fetlock would disappear, and it did, and he started home, eager to amaze his father and mother with his magic pebble."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,22,He could hardly wait to see their faces.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,23,Maybe they wouldn't even believe him at first.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,24,"As he was crossing strawberry Hill, thinking of some of the many, many things he could wish for, he was startled to see a mean, hungry lion looking right at him from behind some tall grass."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,25,He was frightened.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,26,"If he hadn't been so frightened, he could have made the lion disappear, or he could have wished himself safe at home with his father and mother."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,27,He could have wished the lion would turn into a butterfly or a daisy or a gnat.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,28,"He could have wished many things, but he panicked and couldn't think carefully."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,29,"I wish I were a rock, he said, and he became a rock."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,30,"The lion came bounding over, sniffed the rock a hundred times, walked around and around it, and went away confused, perplexed, puzzled, and bewildered."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,31,I saw that little donkey as clear as day.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,32,"Maybe I'm going crazy, he muttered."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,33,"And there was Sylvester, a rock on Strawberry Hill, with the magic pebble lying right beside him on the ground, and he was unable to pick it up."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,34,"Oh, how I wish I were myself again, he thought, but nothing happened."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,35,"He had to be touching the pebble to make the magic work, but there was nothing he could do about it."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,36,His thoughts began to race like mad.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,37,He was scared and worried.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,38,"Being helpless, he felt hopeless."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,39,"He imagined all the possibilities, and eventually he realized that his only chance of becoming himself again was for someone to find the red pebble and to wish that the rock next to it would be a donkey."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,40,Someone would surely find the red pebble – it was so bright and shiny - but what on earth would make them wish that a rock were a donkey?
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,41,The chance was one in a billion at best.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,42,Sylvester fell asleep.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,43,What else could he do?
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,44,Night came with many stars.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,45,"Meanwhile, back at home, Mr. and Mrs. Duncan paced the floor, frantic with worry."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,46,Sylvester had never come home later than dinner time.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,47,Where could he be?
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,48,"They stayed up all night wondering what had happened, expecting that Sylvester would surely turn up by morning."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,49,"But he didn't, of course."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,50,Mrs. Duncan cried a lot and Mr. Duncan did his best to soothe her.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,51,Both longed to have their dear son with them.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,52,"I will never scold Sylvester again as long as I live, said Mrs. Duncan, no matter what he does."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,53,"At dawn, they went about inquiring of all the neighbors."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,54,"They talked to all the children - the puppies, the kittens, the colts, the piglets."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,55,No one had seen Sylvester since the day before yesterday.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,56,They went to the police.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,57,The police could not find their child.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,58,All the dogs in Oatsdale went searching for him.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,59,"They sniffed behind every rock and tree and blade of grass, into every nook and gully of the neighborhood and beyond, but found not a scent of him."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,60,"They sniffed the rock on strawberry Hill, but it smelled like a rock."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,61,It didn't smell like Sylvester.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,62,"After a month of searching the same places over and over again, and inquiring of the same animals over and over again, Mr. and Mrs. Duncan no longer knew what to do."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,63,They concluded that something dreadful must have happened and that they would probably never see their son again.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,64,(Though all the time he was less than a mile away.)
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,65,"They tried their best to be happy, to go about their usual ways."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,66,But their usual ways included Sylvester and they were always reminded of him.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,67,They were miserable.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,68,Life had no meaning for them any more.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,69,Night followed day and day followed night over and over again.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,70,Sylvester on the hill woke up less and less often.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,71,"When he was awake, he was only hopeless and unhappy."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,72,He felt he would be a rock forever and he tried to get used to it.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,73,He went into an endless sleep.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,74,The days grew colder.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,75,Fall came with the leaves changing color.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,76,Then the leaves fell and the grass bent to the ground.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,77,Then it was winter.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,78,"The winds blew, this way and that."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,79,It snowed.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,80,"Mostly, the animals stayed indoors, living on the food they had stored up."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,81,One day a wolf sat on the rock that was Sylvester and howled and howled because he was hungry.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,82,Then the snows melted.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,83,The earth warmed up in the spring sun and things budded.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,84,Leaves were on the trees again.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,85,Flowers showed their young faces.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,86,"One day in May, Mr. Duncan insisted that his wife go with him on a picnic."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,87,"Let's cheer up, he said."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,88,"Let us try to live again and be happy even though Sylvester, our angel, is no longer with us."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,89,They went to Strawberry Hill.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,90,Mrs. Duncan sat down on the rock.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,91,The warmth of his own mother sitting on him woke Sylvester up from his deep winter sleep.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,92,"How he wanted to shout, Mother! Father!"
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,93,"It's me, Sylvester, I'm right here!"
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,94,But he couldn't talk.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,95,He had no voice.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,96,He was stone-dumb.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,97,"Mr. Duncan walked aimlessly about while Mrs. Duncan set out the picnic food on the rock - alfalfa sandwiches, pickled oats, sassafras salad, timothy compote."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,98,Suddenly Mr. Duncan saw the red pebble.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,99,What a fantastic pebble! he exclaimed.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,100,Sylvester would have loved it for his collection.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,101,He put the pebble on the rock.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,102,They sat down to eat.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,103,Sylvester was now as wide awake as a donkey that was a rock could possibly be.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,104,Mrs. Duncan felt some mysterious excitement.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,105,"You know, Father, she said suddenly, I have the strangest feeling that our dear Sylvester is still alive and not far away."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,106,"I am, I am! Sylvester wanted to shout, but he couldn't."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,107,If only he had realized that the pebble resting on his back was the magic pebble!
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,108,"Oh, how I wish he were here with us on this lovely May day, said Mrs. Duncan."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,109,Mr. Duncan looked sadly at the ground.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,110,"Don't you wish it too, Father? she said."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,111,"He looked at her as if to say, How can you ask such a question?"
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,112,Mr. and Mrs. Duncan looked at each other with great sorrow.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,113,"I wish I were myself again, I wish I were my real self again! thought Sylvester."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,114,"And in less than an instant, he was!"
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,115,"You can imagine the scene that followed - the embraces, the kisses, the questions, the answers, the loving looks, and the fond exclamations!"
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,116,"When they had eventually calmed down a bit, and had gotten home, Mr. Duncan put the magic pebble in an iron safe."
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,117,"Some day they might want to use it, but really, for now, what more could they wish for?"
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,118,They all had all that they wanted.
M22,SYLVESTER AND THE MAGIC PEBBLE,WILLIAM STEIG,119,The End
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,1,Once there was a tree . . . and she loved a little boy.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,2,And every day the boy would come and he would gather her leaves and make them into crowns and play king of the forest.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,3,He would climb up her trunk and swing from her branches and eat apples.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,4,And they would play hide-and-go-seek.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,5,"And when he was tired, he would sleep in her shade."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,6,And the boy loved the tree . . . very much.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,7,And the tree was happy.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,8,But time went by.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,9,And the boy grew older.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,10,And the tree was often alone.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,11,"Then one day the boy came to the tree and the tree said, Come, Boy, come and climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and eat apples and play in my shade and be happy."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,12,"I am too big to climb and play, said the boy."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,13,I want to buy things and have fun.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,14,I want some money.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,15,Can you give me some money?
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,16,"I'm sorry, said the tree, but I have no money."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,17,I have only leaves and apples.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,18,"Take my apples, Boy, and sell them in the city."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,19,Then you will have money and you will be happy.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,20,And so the boy climbed up the tree and gathered her apples and carried them away.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,21,And the tree was happy.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,22,But the boy stayed away for a long time. . . and the tree was sad.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,23,"And then one day the boy came back and the tree shook with joy and she said, Come, Boy, climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and be happy."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,24,"I am too busy to climb trees, said the boy."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,25,"I want a house to keep me warm, he said."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,26,"I want a wife and I want children, and so I need a house."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,27,Can you give me a house?
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,28,"I have no house, said the tree."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,29,"The forest is my house, but you may cut off my branches and build a house."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,30,Then you will be happy.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,31,And so the boy cut off her branches and carried them away to build his house.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,32,And the tree was happy.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,33,But the boy stayed away for a long time.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,34,"And when he came back, the tree was so happy she could hardly speak."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,35,"Come, Boy, she whispered, come and play."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,36,"I am too old and sad to play, said the boy."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,37,I want a boat that will take me far away from here.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,38,Can you give me a boat?
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,39,"Cut down my trunk and make a boat, said the tree."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,40,Then you can sail away . . . and be happy.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,41,And so the boy cut down her trunk and made a boat and sailed away.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,42,And the tree was happy . . . but not really.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,43,And after a long time the boy came back again.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,44,"I am sorry, Boy, said the tree, but I have nothing left to give you-"
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,45,My apples are gone.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,46,"My teeth are too weak for apples, said the boy."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,47,"My branches are gone, said the tree."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,48,You cannot swing on them-
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,49,"I am too old to swing on branches, said the boy."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,50,"My trunk is gone, said the tree."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,51,You cannot climb-
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,52,"I am too tired to climb, said the boy."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,53,"I am sorry, sighed the tree."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,54,I wish that I could give you something . . . but I have nothing left.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,55,I am just an old stump.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,56,I am sorry- . . .
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,57,"I don't need very much now, said the boy, just a quiet place to sit and rest."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,58,I am very tired.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,59,"Well, said the tree, straightening herself up as much as she could, well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,60,"Come, Boy, sit down."
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,61,Sit down and rest.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,62,And the boy did.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,63,And the tree was happy.
M23,THE GIVING TREE,SHEL SILVERSTEIN,64,The End
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,1,"On Christmas eve, many years ago, I lay quietly in my bed."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,2,I did not rustle the sheets.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,3,I breathed slowly and silently.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,4,I was listening for a sound - a sound a friend had told me I'd never hear - the ringing bells of Santa's sleigh.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,5,"There is no Santa, my friend has insisted but I knew he was wrong."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,6,"Late that night I did hear sounds, though not of ringing bells."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,7,From outside came the sounds of hissing steam and squeaking metal.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,8,I looked through my window and saw a train standing perfectly still in front of my house.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,9,It was wrapped in an apron of  steam.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,10,Snowflakes fell lightly around it.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,11,A conductor  stood at the open door of  one of the  cars.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,12,"He took a large pocket watch from  his vest, then looked up at my window."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,13,I put on my slippers and robe.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,14,I tiptoed downstairs and out the door.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,15,"All aboard, the conductor cried out."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,16,I ran up to him.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,17,"Well, he said, are you coming?"
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,18,Where? I asked.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,19,"Why, to the North Pole of course, was his answer."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,20,This is the Polar Express.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,21,I took his outstretched hand and he pulled me aboard.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,22,"The train was filled with other children, all in their pajamas and nightgowns."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,23,We sang Christmas carols and ate candies with nougat  centers as white as snow.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,24,We drank hot cocoa as thick and rich as melted chocolate  bars.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,25,Outside the lights of towns and villages flickered in the distance as the Polar Express raced northward.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,26,Soon there were no more lights to be seen.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,27,"We traveled through cold, dark forests, where lean wolves roamed and white-tailed rabbits hid from our train as it thundered through the quiet wilderness."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,28,We climbed mountains so high it seemed as if we would  scrape the moon.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,29,But the Polar Express never slowed down.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,30,"Faster and faster we ran along, rolling over peaks and through valleys like a  car on a roller coaster."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,31,"The mountains turned into hills, the hills to snow-covered plains.'"
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,32,We crossed a barren desert of ice - the Great Polar Ice Cap.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,33,Lights appeared in the distance.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,34,They looked like the lights of a strange ocean liner sailing on a frozen sea.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,35,"'There, said the conductor, is the North Pole."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,36,The North Pole.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,37,"It was a huge city standing alone at the top of the world, filled with factories where  every Christmas toy  was made."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,38,At first we saw no elves.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,39,"They are gathering at the center of the city, the conductor told us."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,40,That is where Santa will give the first gift of Christmas.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,41,Who receives the first gift? we all asked.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,42,The conductor answered.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,43,He will choose one of you.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,44,"Look, shouted one of the children, the elves."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,45,Outside we saw hundreds of elves.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,46,"As our train drew closer to the center of the North Pole, we slowed to a crawl, so crowded were the streets with Santa's helpers."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,47,"When the Polar Express could go no farther, we stopped and the conductor led us outside."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,48,"We pressed through the crowd to the edge of a large, open circle."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,49,In front of us stood Santa's sleigh.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,50,The reindeer were excited.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,51,"They pranced and paced, ringing the silver sleigh bells that hung from their harnesses."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,52,"It was a magical sound, like nothing I'd ever heard."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,53,"Across the circle, the elves moved apart and Santa Claus appeared."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,54,The elves cheered wildly.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,55,"He marched over to us and, pointing to me, said, Let's have this fellow here."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,56,He jumped into his sleigh.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,57,The conductor handed me up.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,58,"I sat on Santa's knee and he asked, Now, what would you like for Christmas?"
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,59,I knew that I could have any gift I could imagine.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,60,But the thing I wanted most for Christmas was not inside Santa's giant bag.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,61,What I wanted more than anything was one silver bell from Santa's sleigh.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,62,"When I asked, Santa smiled."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,63,Then he gave me a hug and told an elf to cut a bell from a reindeer's harness.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,64,The elf tossed it up to Santa.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,65,"He stood, holding the bell high above him, and called out, The first gift of Christmas!"
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,66,A clock struck midnight as the elves roared their approval.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,67,"Santa handed the bell to me, and I put it in my bathrobe pocket."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,68,The conductor helped me down from the sleigh.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,69,Santa shouted out the reindeer's names and cracked his whip.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,70,His team charged forward and climbed into the air.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,71,"Santa circled once above us, then disappeared in the cold, dark polar sky."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,72,"As soon as we were back inside the Polar Express, the other children asked to see the bell."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,73,I reached into my pocket but the only thing I felt was a hole.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,74,I had lost the silver bell from Santa Claus's sleigh.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,75,"Let's hurry outside and look for it, one of the children said."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,76,But the train gave a sudden lurch and started moving.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,77,We were on our way home.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,78,It broke my heart to lose the bell.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,79,"When the train reached my house, I sadly left the other children."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,80,I stood at my doorway and waved good-bye.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,81,"The conductor said something from the moving train, but I couldn't hear him."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,82,What? I yelled out.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,83,He cupped his hands around his mouth.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,84,"MERRY CHRISTMAS, he shouted."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,85,The Polar Express let out a loud blast from its whistle and sped away.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,86,On Christmas morning my little sister Sarah and I opened our  presents.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,87,"When it looked as if everything had been unwrapped, Sarah found one last small box behind the tree."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,88,It had my name on it.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,89,Inside was the silver bell!
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,90,There was a note: Found this on the seat of my sleigh.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,91,"Fix that hole in your pocket. Signed, Mr. C."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,92,I shook the bell.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,93,It made the most beautiful sound my sister and I had ever heard.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,94,"But my mother said, Oh, that's too bad."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,95,"Yes, said my father, it's broken."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,96,"When I'd shaken the bell, my parents had not heard a sound."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,97,"At one time most of my friends could hear the bell, but as  years passed, it fell silent for all of them."
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,98,Even Sarah found one Christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound.
M24,THE POLAR EXPRESS,CHRIS VAN ALLSBURG,99,"Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe."

M25,DEAR ZOO,ROD CAMPBELL,25,I kept him.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,1,Once upon a time there was a Little House way out in the country.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,2,She was a pretty Little House and she was strong and well built.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,3,"The man who built her so well said, This Little House shall never be sold for gold or silver and she will live to see our great-great-grandchildren's great-great-grandchildren living in her."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,4,The Little House was very happy as she sat on the hill and watched the countryside around her.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,5,She watched the sun rise in the morning and she watched the sun set in the evening.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,6,"Day followed day, each one a little different form the one before . . . but the Little House stayed just the same."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,7,"In the nights she watched the moon grow from a thin new moon to a full moon, then back again to a thin old moon; and when there was no moon she watched the stars."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,8,Way off in the distance she could see the lights of the city.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,9,The Little House was curious about the city and wondered what it would be like to live there.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,10,Time passed quickly for the Little House as she watched the countryside slowly change with the seasons.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,11,"In the Spring, when the days grew longer and the sun warmer, she waited for the first robin to return from the South."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,12,She watched the grass turn green.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,13,She watched the buds on the trees swell and the apple trees burst into blossom.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,14,She watched the children playing in the brook.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,15,In the long Summer days she sat in the sun and watched the trees cover themselves with leaves and the white daisies cover the hill.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,16,"She watched the gardens grow, and she watched the apples turn red and ripen."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,17,She watched the children swimming in the pool.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,18,"In the Fall, when the days grew shorter and the nights colder, she watched the first frost turn the leaves to bright yellow and orange and red."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,19,She watched the harvest gathered and the apples picked.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,20,She watched the children going back to school.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,21,"In the Winter, when the nights were long and the days short, and the countryside covered with snow, she watched the children coasting and skating."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,22,Year followed year.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,23,The apple trees grew old and new ones were planted.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,24,The children grew up and went away to the city . . . and now at night the lights of the city seemed brighter and closer.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,25,One day the Little House was surprised to see a horseless carriage coming down the winding country road.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,26,Pretty soon there were more of them on the road and fewer carriages pulled by horses.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,27,Pretty soon along came some surveyors and surveyed a line in front of the Little House.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,28,Pretty soon along came a steam shovel and dug a road through the hill covered with daisies.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,29,"Then some trucks came and dumped big stones on the road, then some trucks with little stones, then some trucks with tar and sand, and finally a steam roller came and rolled it all smooth, and the road was done."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,30,Now the Little House watched the trucks and automobiles going back and forth to the city.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,31,Gasoline stations . . . roadside stands . . . and small houses followed the new road.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,32,Everyone and everything moved much faster now than before.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,33,"More roads were made, and the countryside was divided into lots."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,34,More houses and bigger houses . . . apartment houses and tenement houses . . . schools . . . stores . . . and garages spread over the land and crowded around the Little House.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,35,No one wanted to live in her and take care of her any more.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,36,"She couldn't be sold for gold or silver, so she just stayed there and watched."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,37,Now it was not so quiet and peaceful at night.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,38,"Now the lights of the city were bright and very close, and the street lights shone all night."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,39,"This must be living in the city, thought the Little House, and didn't know whether she liked it or not."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,40,She missed the field of daisies and the apple trees dancing in the moonlight.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,41,Pretty soon there were trolley cars going back and forth in front of the Little House.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,42,They went back and forth all day and part of the night.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,43,Everyone seemed to be very busy and everyone seemed to be in a hurry.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,44,Pretty soon there was an elevated train going back and forth above the Little House.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,45,"The air was filled with dust and smoke, and the noise was so loud that it shook the Little House."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,46,"Now she couldn't tell when Spring came, or Summer or Fall, or Winter."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,47,It al seemed about the same.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,48,Pretty soon there was a subway going back and forth underneath the Little House.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,49,"She couldn't see it, but she could feel and hear it."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,50,People were moving faster and faster.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,51,No one noticed the Little House any more.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,52,They hurried by without a glance.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,53,Pretty soon they tore down the apartment houses and tenement houses around the Little House and started digging big cellars . . . one on each side.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,54,The steam shovels dug down three stories on one side and four stories on the other side.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,55,Pretty soon they started building up . . .
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,56,They built up twenty-five stories on one side and thirty-five stories on the other.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,57,"Now the Little House only saw the sun at noon, and didn't see the moon or starts at night at all because the lights of the city were too bright."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,58,She didn't like living in the city.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,59,At night she used to dream of the country and the field of daisies and the apple trees dancing in the moonlight.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,60,The Little House was very sad and lonely.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,61,Her paint was cracked and dirty . . .
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,62,Her windows were broken and her shutters hung crookedly.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,63,She looked shabby . . . though she was just as good a house as ever underneath.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,64,Then one fine morning in Spring along came the great-great-granddaughter of the man who built the Little House so well.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,65,"She saw the shabby Little House, but she didn't hurry by."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,66,There was something about the Little House that made her stop and look again.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,67,"She said to her husband, That Little House looks just like the Little House my grandmother lived in when she was a little girl, only that Little House was way out in the country on a hill covered with daisies and apple trees growing around."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,68,"The found out it was the very same house, so the went to the Movers to see if the Little House could be moved."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,69,"The Movers looked the Little House all over and said, Sure, this house is as good as ever."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,70,She's build so well we could move her anywhere.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,71,So they jacked up the Little House and put her on wheels.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,72,Traffic was held up for hours as they slowly moved her out of the city.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,73,"At first the Little House was frightened, but after she got used to it she rather liked it."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,74,"They rolled along the big road, and they rolled along the little roads, until they were way out in the country."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,75,"When the Little House saw the green grass and heard the birds singing, she didn't feel sad any more."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,76,"They went along and along, but they couldn't seem to find just the right place."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,77,"They tried the Little House here, and they tried her there."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,78,Finally they saw a little hill in the middle of the field . . . and apple trees growing around.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,79,"There, said the great-great-granddaughter, that's just the place."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,80,"Yes, it is, said the Little House to herself."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,81,A cellar was dug on top of the hill and slowly they moved the house from the road to the hill.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,82,The windows and shutters were fixed and once again they painted her a lovely shade of pink.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,83,"As the Little House settled down on her new foundation, she smiled happily."
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,84,Once again she could watch the sun and moon and stars.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,85,Once again she could watch Spring and Summer and Fall and Winter come and go.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,86,Once again she was lived in and taken care of.
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,87,Never again would she be curious about the city . . .
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,88,Never again would she want to live there . . .
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,89,The stars twinkled above her . . .
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,90,A new moon was coming up . . .
M26,THE LITTLE HOUSE,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,91,It was Spring . . . and all was peaceful in the country.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,1,At the far end of town where Grickle-grass grows and the wind smells slow-and-sour when it blows and no birds ever sing expecting old crows . . . is the street of the Lifted Lorax.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,2,"And deep in the Grickle-grass, some people say, if you look deep enough you can still see, today, where the Lorax once stood just as long as it could before somebody lifted the Lorax away."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,3,What was the Lorax?
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,4,And why was it there?
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,5,And why was it lifted and taken somewhere from the far end of town where the Grickle-grass grows?
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,6,The old Once-ler still lives here.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,7,Ask him.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,8,He knows.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,9,You won't see the Once-ler.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,10,Don't knock at his door.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,11,He stays in his Lerkim on top of his store.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,12,"He lurks in his Lerkim, cold under the roof, where he makes his own clothes out of miff-muffered moof."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,13,"And on special dank midnights in August, he peeks out of the shutters and sometimes he speaks and tells how the Lorax was lifted away."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,14,"He'll tell you, perhaps . . . if you're willing to pay."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,15,On the end of a rope he lets down a tin pail and you have to toss in fifteen cents and a nail and the shell of a great-great-great-grandfather snail.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,16,"Then he pulls up the pail, makes a most careful count to see if you've paid him the proper amount."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,17,"Then he hides what you paid him away in his Snuvv, his secret strange hole in his gruvvulous glove."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,18,"Then he grunts, I will call you by Whisper-ma-Phone, for the secrets I tell are for your ears alone."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,19,Slupp!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,20,"Down slupps the Whisper-ma-Phone to your ear and the old Once-ler's whispers are not very clear, since they have to come down through a snergelly hose, and he sounds as if he had smallish bees up his nose."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,21,"Now I'll tell you, he says, with his teeth sounding gray, how the Lorax got lifted and taken away . . ."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,22,"It all started way back . . . such a long, long time back . . ."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,23,"What back in the days when the grass was still green and the pond was still wet and the clouds were still clean, and the song of the Swomee-Swans rang out in space . . . one morning, I came to this glorious place."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,24,And I first saw the trees!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,25,The Truffula Trees!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,26,The bright-colored tufts of the Truffula Trees!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,27,Mile after mile in the fresh morning breeze.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,28,"And under the trees, I saw Brown Bar-ba-loots frisking about in their Bar-ba-loot suits as they played in the shade and ate Truffula Fruits."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,29,From the rippulous pond came the comfortable sound of the Humming-Fish humming while splashing around.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,30,But those trees!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,31,Those trees!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,32,Those Truffula Trees!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,33,All my life I'd been searching for trees such as these.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,34,The touch of their tufts was much softer than silk.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,35,And they had the sweet smell of fresh butterfly milk.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,36,I felt a great leaping of joy in my heart.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,37,I knew just what I'd do!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,38,I unloaded my cart.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,39,"In no time at all, I had built a small shop."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,40,Then I chopped down a Truffula Tree with one chop.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,41,"And with great skillful skill and with great speedy speed, I took the soft tuft."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,42,And I knitted a Thneed!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,43,"The instant I'd finished, I heard a ga-Zump!"
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,44,I looked.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,45,I saw something pop out of the stump of the tree I'd chopped down.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,46,It was sort of a man.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,47,Describe him? . . .
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,48,That's hard.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,49,I don't know if I can.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,50,He was shortish.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,51,And oddish.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,52,And brownish.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,53,And mossy.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,54,And he spoke with a voice that was sharpish and bossy.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,55,"Mister! he said with a sawdusty sneeze, I am the Lorax."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,56,I speak for the trees.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,57,"I speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,58,"And I'm asking you, sir, at the top of my lungs – he was very upset as he shouted and puffed – What's that thing you've made out of my Turffula tuft?"
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,59,"Look, Lorax, I said."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,60,There's no cause for alarm.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,61,I chopped just one tree.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,62,I am doing no harm.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,63,I'm being quite useful.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,64,This thing is a Thneed.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,65,A Thneed's a Fine-Something-That-All-People-Need!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,66,It's a shirt.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,67,It's a sock.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,68,It's a glove.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,69,It's a hat.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,70,But it has other uses.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,71,"Yes, far beyond that."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,72,You can use it for carpets.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,73,For pillows!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,74,For sheets!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,75,Or curtains!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,76,Or covers for bicycle seats!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,77,"The Lorax said, Sir! You are crazy with greed."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,78,There is no one on earth who would buy that fool Thneed!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,79,But the very next minute I proved he was wrong.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,80,"For, just at the minute, a chap came along, and he thought that the Thneed I had knitted was great."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,81,He happily bought it for three ninety-eight.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,82,"I laughed at the Lorax, You poor stupid guy!"
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,83,You never can tell what some people will buy.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,84,"I repeat, cried the Lorax, I speak for the trees!"
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,85,"I'm busy, I told him."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,86,"Shut up, if you please."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,87,"I rushed 'cross the room, and in no time at all, built a radio-phone."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,88,I put in a quick call.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,89,"I called all my brothers and uncles and aunts and I said, Listen here! Here's a wonderful chance for the whole Once-ler Family to get mighty rich!"
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,90,Get over here fast!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,91,Take the road to North Nitch.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,92,Turn left at Weehawken.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,93,Sharp right at South Stitch.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,94,"And, in no time at all, in the factory I built, the whole Once-ler Family was working full tilt."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,95,"We were all knitting Thneeds just as busy as bees, to the sound of the chopping of Truffula Trees."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,96,Then . . .
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,97,Oh!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,98,Baby!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,99,Oh!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,100,How my business did grow!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,101,"Now, chopping one tree at a time was too slow."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,102,So I quickly invented my Super-Axe-Hacker which whacked off four Truffula Trees at one smacker.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,103,We were making Thneeds four times as fast as before!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,104,And that Lorax? . . .
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,105,He didn't show up any more.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,106,But the next week he knocked on my new office door.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,107,"He snapped, I'm the Lorax who speaks for the trees which you seem to be chopping as fast as you please."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,108,"But I'm also in charge of the Brown Bar-ba-loots who played in the shade in their Bar-ba-loot suits and happily lived, eating Truffula Fruits."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,109,"Now . . . thanks to your hacking my trees to the ground, there's not enough Truffula Fruit to go 'round."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,110,"And my poor Bar-ba-loots are all getting the crummies because they have gas, and no food, in their tummies!"
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,111,They loved living here.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,112,But I can't let them stay.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,113,They'll have to find food.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,114,And I hope that they may.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,115,"Good luck, boys, he cried."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,116,And he sent them away.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,117,"I, the Once-ler, felt sad as I watched them all go."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,118,But . . . business is business!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,119,"And businesses must grow regardless of crummies in tummies, you know."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,120,I meant no harm.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,121,I most truly did not.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,122,But I had to grow bigger.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,123,So bigger I got.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,124,I biggered by factory.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,125,I biggered my roads.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,126,I biggered my wagons.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,127,I biggered the loads of the Thneeds I shipped out.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,128,I was shipping them forth to the South!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,129,To the East!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,130,To the West!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,131,To the North!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,132,I went right on biggering . . . selling more Thneeds.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,133,"And I biggered my money, which everyone needs."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,134,Then again he came back!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,135,I was fixing some pipes with that old-nuisance Lorax came back with more gripes.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,136,"I am the Lorax, he coughed and he whiffed."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,137,He sneezed and he snuffled.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,138,He snarggled.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,139,He sniffed.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,140,Once-ler! he cried with a cruffulous croak.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,141,Once-ler!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,142,You're making such smogulous smoke!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,143,"My poor Swomee-Swans . . . why, they can't sing a note!"
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,144,No on can sign who has smog in his throat.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,145,"And so, said the Lorax, - please pardon my cough – they cannot live here."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,146,So I'm sending them off.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,147,Where will they go? . . .
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,148,I don't hopefully know.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,149,They may have to fly for a month . . . or a year . . .
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,150,To escape from the smog you've smogged-up around here.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,151,"What's more, snapped the Lorax."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,152,(His dander was up.)
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,153,Let me say a few words about Gluppity-Glupp.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,154,"Your machinery chugs on, day and night without stop making Gluppity-Glupp."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,155,Also Schloppity-Schlopp.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,156,And what do you do with this leftover goo? . . .
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,157,I'll show you.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,158,"You dirty old Once-ler man, you!"
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,159,You're glumping the pond where the Humming-Fish hummed!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,160,"No more can they hum, for their gills are all gummed."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,161,So I'm sending them off.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,162,"Oh, their future is dreary."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,163,They'll walk on their fins and get woefully weary in search of some water that isn't so smeary.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,164,And then I got mad.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,165,I got terribly mad.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,166,"I yelled at the Lorax, Now listen here, Dad!"
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,167,"All you do is yap-yap and say, 'Bad! Bad! Bad! Bad!'"
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,168,"Well, I have my rights, sir, and I'm telling you I intend to go on doing just what I do!"
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,169,"And, for your information, you Lorax, I'm figgering on biggering and biggering and biggering and biggering, turning more Truffula Trees into Thneeds which everyone, everyone, everyone needs!"
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,170,"And at that very moment, we heard a loud whack!"
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,171,From outside in the fields came a sickening smack of an axe on a tree.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,172,Then we heard the tree fall.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,173,The very last Truffula Tree of them all!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,174,No more trees.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,175,No more Thneeds.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,176,No more work to be done.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,177,"So, in no time, my uncles and aunts, every one, all waved me good-bye."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,178,They jumped into my cars and drove away under the smoke-smuggered stars.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,179,Now all that was left ‘neath the bad-smelling sky was my big empty factory . . . the Lorax . . . and I.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,180,The Lorax said nothing.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,181,"Just gave me a glance . . . just gave me a sad, sad backward glance . . . as he lifted himself by the seat of his pants."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,182,"And I'll never forget the grim look on his face when he heisted himself and took leave of this place, through a hole in the smog, without leaving a trace."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,183,"And all the Lorax left here in this mess was a small pile of rocks, with one word . . . unless."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,184,"Whatever that meant, well, I just couldn't guess."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,185,"That was long, long, ago."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,186,But each day since that day I've sat here and worried and worried away.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,187,"Through the years, while my buildings have fallen apart, I've worried about it with all of my heart."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,188,"But now, says the Once-ler, Now that you're here, the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,189,"Unless someone like you cares a while awful lot, nothing is going to get better."
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,190,It's not.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,191,So . . .
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,192,Catch! calls the Once-ler.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,193,He lets something fall.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,194,It's a Truffula Seed.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,195,It's the last one of all!
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,196,You're in charge of the last of the Truffula Seeds.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,197,And Truffula Trees are what everyone needs.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,198,Plant a new Truffula.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,199,Treat it with care.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,200,Give it clean water.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,201,And feed it fresh air.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,202,Grow a forest.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,203,Protect it from axes that hack.
M27,THE LORAX,DR. SEUSS,204,Then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,1,Once there was a little bunny who wanted to run away.
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,2,"So he said to his mother, I am running away."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,3,"If you run away said, his mother, I will run after you."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,4,For you are my little bunny.
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,5,"If you run after me, said the little bunny, I will become a fish in a trout stream and I will swim away from you."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,6,"If you become a fish in a trout stream, said his mother,"
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,7,I will become a fisherman and I will fish for you.
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,8,"If you become a fisherman, said the little bunny, I will become a rock on the mountain, high above you."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,9,"If you become a rock on the mountain high above me, said his mother, I will be a mountain climber, and I will climb to where you are."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,10,"If you become a mountain climber, said the little bunny, I will be a crocus in a hidden garden."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,11,"If you become a crocus in a hidden garden, said his mother, I will be a gardener."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,12,And I will find you.
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,13,"If you are a gardener and find me, said the little bunny, I will be a bird and fly away from you."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,14,"If you become a bird and fly away from me, said his mother, I will be a tree that you come home to."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,15,"If you become a tree, said the little bunny, I will become a little sailboat, and I will sail away from you."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,16,"If you become a sailboat and sail away from me, said his mother, I will become the wind and blow you where I want you to go."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,17,"If you become the wind and blow me, said the little bunny, I will join a circus and fly away on a flying trapeze."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,18,"If you go flying on a flying trapeze, said his mother, I will be a tightrope walker, and I will walk across the air to you."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,19,"If you become a tightrope walker and walk across the air, said the bunny, I will become a little boy and run into a house."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,20,"If you become a little boy and run into a house, said the mother bunny, I will become your mother and catch you in my arms and hug you."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,21,"Shucks, said the bunny, I might just as well stay where I am and be your little bunny."
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,22,And so he did.
M28,THE RUNAWAY BUNNY,MARGARET WISE BROWN,23,"Have a carrot, said the mother bunny."
M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,1,"I went to sleep with gum in my mouth and now there's gum in my hair and when I got out of bed this morning I tripped on the skateboard and by mistake I dropped my sweater in the sink while the water was running and I could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day."

M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,15,"I could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day."
M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,16,I could tell because Paul said I wasn't his best friend anymore.
M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,17,He said that Philip Parker was his best friend and that Albert Moyo was his next best friend and that I was only his third best friend.
M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,18,"I hope you sit on a tack, I said to Paul."
M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,19,I hope the next time you get a double decker strawberry ice-cream cone the ice cream part falls off the cone part and lands in Australia.
M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,20,There were two cupcakes in Philip Parker's lunch bag and Albert got a Hershey bar with almonds and Paul's mother gave him a piece of jelly roll that had little coconut sprinkles on the top.

M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,26,On the way downstairs the elevator door closed on my foot and while we were waiting for my mom to go get the car Anthony made me fall where it was muddy and then when I started crying because of the mud Nick said I was a crybaby and while I was punching Nick for saying crybaby my mom came back with the car and scolded me for being muddy and fighting.
M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,27,"I am having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day, I told everybody."

M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,29,So then we went to the shoe store to buy some sneakers.
M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,30,Anthony chose white ones with blue stripes.
M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,31,Nick chose red ones with white stripes.
M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,32,"I chose blue ones with red stripes but then the shoe man said, we're all sold out."
M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,33,"They made me buy plain old white ones, but they can't make me wear them."
M29,"ALEXANDER AND THE TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE, NO GOOD, VERY BAD DAY",JUDITH VIORST,34,"When we picked up my dad at his office he said I couldn't play with his copying machine, but I forgot."

M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,1,Camilla Cream loved lima beans.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,2,But she never ate them.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,3,"All of her friends hated lima beans, and she wanted to fit in."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,4,Camilla was always worried about what other people thought of her.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,5,Today she was fretting even more than usual.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,6,"It was the first day of school, and she couldn't decide what to wear."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,7,There were so many people to impress!
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,8,"She tried on forty-two outfits, but none seemed quite right."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,9,She put on a pretty red dress and looked in the mirror.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,10,Then she screamed.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,11,"Her mother ran into the room, and she screamed, too."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,12,Oh my heavens! she cried.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,13,You're completely covered with stripes!
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,14,This was certainly true.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,15,Camilla was striped from head to toe.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,16,She looked like a rainbow.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,17,Mrs. Cream felt Camilla's forehead.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,18,Do you feel all right? she asked.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,19,"I feel fine, Camilla answered, but just look at me!"
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,20,"You get back in bed this instant, her mother ordered."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,21,You're not going to school today.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,22,Camilla was relieved.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,23,"She didn't want to miss the first day of school, but she was afraid of what the other kids would say."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,24,And she had no idea what to wear with those crazy stripes.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,25,"That afternoon, Dr. Bumble came to examine Camilla."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,26,Most extraordinary! he exclaimed.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,27,l've never seen anything like it.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,28,"Are you having any coughing, sneezing, runny nose, aches, pains, chills, hot flashes, dizziness, drowsiness, shortness of breath, or uncontrollable twitching?"
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,29,"No, Camilla told him."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,30,I feel fine.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,31,"Well then, Dr. Bumble said, turning to Mrs. Cream, l don't see any reason why she shouldn't go to school tomorrow."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,32,Here's some ointment that should help clear up those stripes in a few days.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,33,"If it doesn't, you know where to reach me."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,34,And off he went.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,35,The next day was a disaster.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,36,Everyone at school laughed at Camilla.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,37,They called her Camilla Crayon and Night of the Living Lollipop.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,38,"She tried her best to act as if everything were normal, but when the class said the Pledge of Allegiance, her stripes turned red, white, and blue, and she broke out in stars!"
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,39,The other kids thought this was great.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,40,"One yelled out, Let's see some purple polka dots!"
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,41,"Sure enough, Camilla turned all purple polka-dotty."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,42,"Someone else shouted, Checkerboard! and a pattern of squares covered her skin."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,43,"Soon everyone was calling out different shapes and colors, and poor Camilla was changing faster than you can change channels on a T.V."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,44,"That night, Mr. Harms, the school principal, called."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,45,"l'm sorry, Mrs. Cream, he said."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,46,I'm going to have to ask you to keep Camilla home from school.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,47,"She's just too much of a distraction, and I've been getting calls from the other parents."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,48,They're afraid those stripes may be contagious.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,49,Camilla was so embarrassed.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,50,She couldn't believe that two days ago everyone liked her.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,51,"Now, nobody wanted to be in the same room with her."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,52,Her father tried to make her feel better.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,53,"Is there anything I can get you, sweetheart? he asked."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,54,"No, thank you, sighed Camilla."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,55,"What she really wanted was a nice plate of lima beans, but she had been laughed at enough for one day."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,56,"Hmm, well, yes, I see, Dr. Bumble mumbled when Mr. Cream phoned the next day."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,57,I think I'd better bring in the Specialists.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,58,We'll be right over.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,59,"About an hour later, Dr. Bumble arrived with four people in long white coats."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,60,He introduced them to the Creams.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,61,"This is Dr. Grop, Dr. Sponge, Dr. Cricket, and Dr. Young."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,62,Then the Specialists went to work on Camilla.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,63,"They squeezed and jabbed, tapped and tested."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,64,It was very uncomfortable.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,65,"Well, it's not the mumps, concluded Dr. Grop."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,66,"Or the measles, said Dr. Sponge."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,67,"Definitely not chicken pox, put in Dr. Cricket."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,68,"Or sunburn, said Dr. Young."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,69,"Try these, said the Specialists."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,70,They each handed her a bottle filled with different colored pills.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,71,"Take one of each before bed, said Dr. Grop."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,72,"Then they filed out the front door, followed by Dr. Bumble."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,73,"That night, Camilla took her medicine."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,74,It was awful.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,75,"When she woke up the next morning, she did feel different, but when she got dressed, her clothes didn't fit right."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,76,"She looked in the mirror, and there, staring back at her, was a giant, multi colored pill with her face on it."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,77,Dr. Bumble rushed over as soon as Mrs. Cream called.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,78,"But this time, instead of the Specialists, he brought the Experts."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,79,Dr. Gourd and Mr. Mellon were the finest scientific minds in the land.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,80,"Once again, Camilla was poked and prodded, looked at and listened to."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,81,The Experts wrote down lots of numbers.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,82,Then they huddled together and whispered.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,83,Dr. Gourd finally spoke.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,84,"It might be a virus, he announced with authority."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,85,"Suddenly, fuzzy little virus balls appeared all over Camilla."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,86,"Or possibly some form of bacteria, said Mr. Mellon."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,87,Out popped squiggly little bacteria tails.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,88,"Or it could be a fungus, added Dr. Gourd."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,89,"Instantly, Camilla was covered with different colored fungus blotches."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,90,"The Experts looked at Camilla, then at each other."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,91,"We need to go over these numbers again back at the lab, Dr. Gourd explained."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,92,We'll call you when we know something.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,93,"But the experts didn't have a clue, much less a cure."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,94,"By now, the T.V. news had found out about Camilla."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,95,"Reporters from every channel were outside her house, telling the story of The Bizarre Case of the Incredible Changing Kid."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,96,Soon a huge crowd was camped out on the front lawn.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,97,"The Creams were swamped with all kinds of remedies from psychologists, allergists, herbalists, nutritionists, psychics, an old medicine man, a guru, and even a veterinarian."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,98,Each so-called cure only added to poor Camilla's strange appearance until it was hard to even recognize her.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,99,She sprouted roots and berries and crystals and feathers and a long furry tail.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,100,But nothing worked.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,101,"One day, a woman who called herself an Environmental Therapist claimed she could cure Camilla."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,102,"Close your eyes, she said."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,103,"Breathe deeply, and become one with your room."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,104,"I wish you hadn't said that, Camilla groaned."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,105,"Slowly, she started to melt into the walls of her room."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,106,"Her bed became her mouth, her nose was a dresses, and two paintings were her eyes."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,107,The therapist screamed and ran from the house.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,108,What are we going to do? cried Mrs. Cream.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,109,It just keeps getting worse and worse! She began to sob.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,110,"At that moment, Mr. Cream heard a quiet little knock at the front door."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,111,"He opened it, and there stood an old woman who was just as plump and sweet as a strawberry."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,112,"Excuse me, she said brightly."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,113,But I think I can help.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,114,She went into Camilla's room and looked around.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,115,"My goodness, she said with a shake of her head."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,116,What we have here is a bad case of stripes.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,117,One of the worst I've ever seen!
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,118,She pulled a container of small green beans from her bag.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,119,"Here, she said."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,120,These might do the trick.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,121,Are those magic beans? asked Mrs. Cream.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,122,"Oh my, ho, replied the kind old woman."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,123,There's no such thing. These are just plain old lima beans.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,124,"I'll bet you'd like some, wouldn't you? she asked Camilla."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,125,"Camilla wanted a big, heaping plateful of lima beans more than just about anything, but she was still afraid to admit it."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,126,Yuck! she said.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,127,"No one likes lima beans, especially me!"
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,128,"Oh, dear, the old woman said sadly."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,129,l guess I was wrong about you.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,130,She put the beans back in her bag and started toward the door.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,131,Camilla watched the old woman walk away.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,132,Those beans would taste so good.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,133,"And being laughed at for eating them was nothing, compared to what she'd been going through."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,134,She finally couldn't stand it.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,135,Wait! she cried.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,136,The truth is . . . I really love lima beans.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,137,"l thought so, the old woman said with a smile."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,138,She took a handful of beans and popped them into Camilla's mouth.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,139,"Mmmm, said Camilla."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,140,"Suddenly the branches, feathers, and squiggly tails began to disappear."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,141,Then the whole room swirled around.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,142,"When it stopped, there stood Camilla, and everything was back to normal."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,143,I'm cured! she shouted.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,144,"Yes, said the old woman."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,145,I knew the real you was in there somewhere.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,146,She patted Camilla on the head.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,147,Then she went outside and vanished into the crowd.
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,148,"Afterward, Camilla wasn't quite the same."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,149,"Some of the kids at school said she was weird, but she didn't care a bit."
M30,A BAD CASE OF STRIPES,DAVID SHANNON,150,"She ate all the lima beans she wanted, and she never had even a touch of stripes again."

M32,THE NAPPING HOUSE,AUDREY WOOD,1,"There is a house, a napping house, where everyone is sleeping."
M32,THE NAPPING HOUSE,AUDREY WOOD,2,"And in that house there is a bed, a cozy bed in a napping house, where everyone is sleeping."
M32,THE NAPPING HOUSE,AUDREY WOOD,3,"And on that bed there is a granny, a snoring granny on a cozy bed in a napping house, where everyone is sleeping."

M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,1,"Mike Mulligan had a steam shovel, a beautiful red steam shovel."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,2,Her name was Mary Anne.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,3,Mike Mulligan was very proud of Mary Anne.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,4,"He always said that she could dig as much in a day as a hundred men could dig in a week, but he had never been quite sure that this was true."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,5,Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne had been digging together for years and years.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,6,Mike Mulligan took such good care of Mary Anne she never grew old.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,7,It was Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne and some others who dug the great canals for the big boats to sail through.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,8,It was Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne and some others who cut through the high mountains so that trains could go through.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,9,It was Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne and some others who lowered the hills and straightened the curves to make the long highways for the automobiles.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,10,It was Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne and some others who smoothed out the ground and filled in the holes to make the landing fields for the airplanes.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,11,And it was Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne and some others who dug the deep holes for the cellars of the tall skyscrapers in the big cities.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,12,"When people used to stop and watch them, Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne used to dig a little faster and a little better."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,13,"The more people stopped, the faster and better they dug."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,14,Some days they would keep as many as thirty-seven trucks busy taking away the dirt they had dug.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,15,Then along came the new gasoline shovels and the new electric shovels and the new Diesel motor shovels and took all the jobs away from the steam shovels.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,16,Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne were VERY SAD.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,17,"All the other steam shovels were being sold for junk, or left out in old gravel pits to rust and fall apart."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,18,Mike loved Mary Anne.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,19,He couldn't do that to her.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,20,He had taken such good care of her that she could still dig as much in a day as a hundred men could dig in a week; at least he thought she could but he wasn't quite sure.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,21,Everywhere they went the new gas shovels and the new electric shovels and the new Diesel motor shovels had all the jobs.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,22,No one wanted Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne any more.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,23,Then one day Mike read in a newspaper that the town of Popperville was going to build a new town hall.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,24,"We are going to dig the cellar of that town hall, said Mike to Mary Anne, and off they started."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,25,They left the canals and the railroads and the highways and the airports and the big cities where no one wanted them anymore and went away out in the country.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,26,They crawled along slowly up the hills and down the hills till they came to the little town of Popperville.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,27,When they got there they found that the selectmen were just deciding who should dig the cellar for the new town hall.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,28,"Mike Mulligan spoke to Henry B. Swap, one of the selectmen."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,29,"I heard, he said, that you are going to build a new town hall."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,30,Mary Anne and I will dig the cellar for you in just one day.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,31,What! said Henry B. Swap.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,32,Dig a cellar in a day!
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,33,It would take a hundred men at least a week to dig the cellar for our new town hall.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,34,"Sure, said Mike, but Mary Anne can dig as much in a day as a hundred men can dig in a week."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,35,Though he had never been quite sure that this was true.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,36,"Then he added, If we can't do it, you won't have to pay."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,37,"Henry B. Swap thought that this would be an easy way to get part of the cellar dug for nothing, so he smiled in rather a mean way and gave the job of digging the cellar of the new town hall to Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,38,They started in early the next morning just as the sun was coming up.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,39,Soon a little boy came along.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,40,Do you think you will finish by sundown? he said to Mike Mulligan.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,41,"Sure, said Mike, if you stay and watch us."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,42,We always work faster and better when someone is watching us.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,43,So the little boy stayed to watch.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,44,"Then Mrs. McGillicuddy, Henry B. Swap, and the Town Constable came over to see what was happening, and they stayed to watch."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,45,Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne dug a little faster and a little better.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,46,This gave the little boy a good idea.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,47,"He ran off and told the postman with-the morning mail, the telegraph boy on his bicycle, the milkman with his cart and horse, the doctor on his way home, and the farmer and his family coming into town for the day, and they all stopped and stayed to watch."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,48,That made Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne dig a little faster and a little better.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,49,They finished the first corner neat and square. . .  but the sun was getting higher.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,50,Clang!
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,51,Clang!
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,52,Clang!
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,53,The Fire Department arrived.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,54,They had seen the smoke and thought there was a fire.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,55,"Then the little boy said, Why don't you stay and watch?"
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,56,So the Fire Department of Popperville stayed to watch Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,57,"When they heard the fire engine, the children in the school across the street couldn't keep their eyes on their lessons."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,58,The teacher called a long recess and the whole school came out to watch.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,59,That made Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne dig still faster and still better.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,60,"They finished the second corner neat and square, but the sun was right up in the top of the sky."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,61,Now the girl who answers the telephone called up the next towns of Bangerville and Bopperville and Kipperville and Kopperville and told them what was happening in Popperville.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,62,All the people came over to see if Mike Mulligan and his steam shovel could dig the cellar in just one day.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,63,"The more people came, the faster Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne dug."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,64,But they would have to hurry.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,65,They were only halfway and the sun was beginning to go down.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,66,They finished the third corner. . .  neat and square.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,67,"Never had Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne had so many people to watch them; never had they dug so fast and so well; and never, had the sun seemed to go down so fast."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,68,"Hurry, Mike Mulligan! Hurry! Hurry!' shouted the little boy."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,69,There's not much more time!
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,70,"Dirt was flying everywhere, and the smoke and steam were so thick that the people could hardly see anything."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,71,But listen!
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,72,Bing!
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,73,Bang!
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,74,Crash!
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,75,Slam!
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,76,Faster and faster.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,77,Then suddenly it was quiet.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,78,Slowly the dirt settled down.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,79,"The smoke and steam cleared away, and there was the cellar all finished."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,80,"Four corners. . .  neat and square; four walls. . .  straight down, and Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne at the bottom, and the sun was just going down behind the hill."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,81,Hurray! shouted the people.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,82,Hurray for Mike Mulligan and his steam shovel!
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,83,They have dug the cellar in just one day.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,84,"Suddenly the little boy said, How are they going to get out?"
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,85,"That's right, said Ms. McGillicuddy to Henry B. Swap."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,86,How is he going to het his steam shovel out?
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,87,"Henry B. Swap didn't answer, but he smiled in rather a mean way."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,88,"Then everybody said, How are they going to get out?"
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,89,Hi!
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,90,Mike Mulligan!
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,91,How are you going to get your steam shovel out?
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,92,"Mike Mulligan looked around at the four square walls and four square corners, and he said, We've dug so fast and we've dug so well that we've quite forgotten to leave a way out!"
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,93,Nothing like this had ever happened to Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne before and they didn't know what to do.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,94,Nothing like this had ever happened before in Popperville.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,95,"Everybody started talking at once, and everybody had a different idea, and everybody thought that his idea was the best."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,96,"They talked and they talked and they argued and they fought till they were worn out, and still no one knew how to get Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne out of the cellar they had dug."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,97,"Then Henry B. Swap said, The job isn't finished because Mary Anne isn't out of the cellar, so Mike Mulligan won't get paid."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,98,And he smiled again in a rather mean way.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,99,"Now the little boy, who had been keeping very quiet, had another good idea."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,100,"He said, why couldn't we leave Mary Anne in the cellar and build the new town hall above her?"
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,101,Let her be the furnace for the new town hall and let Mike Mulligan be the janitor.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,102,"Then you wouldn't have to buy a new furnace, and we could pay Mike Mulligan for digging the cellar in just one day."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,103,"Why not? said Henry B. Swap, and smiled in a way that was not quite so mean."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,104,Why not? said the Town Constable.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,105,Why not? said all the people.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,106,So they found a ladder and climbed down into the cellar to ask Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,107,Why not? said Mike Mulligan.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,108,"So it was decided, and everybody was happy."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,109,They built the new town hall right over Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,110,It was finished before winter.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,111,Every day the little boy goes over to see Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne and Mrs. McGillicuddv takes him nice hot apple pies.
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,112,"As for Henry B. Swap, he spends most of his time in the cellar of the new town hall listening to the stories that Mike Mulligan has to tell and smiling in a way that isn't mean at all."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,113,"Now when you go to Popperville, be sure to go down in the cellar of the new town hall."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,114,"There they'll be, Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne. . ."
M33,MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL,VIRGINIA LEE BURTON,115,"Mike in his rocking chair smoking his pipe, and Mary Anne beside him warming up his meetings in the new town hall."

M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,18,"Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him, and rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,19,"It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,20,"Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flowerpot."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,21,"He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,22,Presently Peter sneezed – Kertyschoo!
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,23,"Mr. McGregor was after him in no time, and tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,24,"The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,25,He went back to his work.
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,26,Peter sat down to rest.
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,27,"He was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had no the least idea which way to go."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,28,"Also, he was very damp with sitting in that can."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,29,"After a time began to wander about, going lippity – lippity – not very fast, and looking all around."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,30,"He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,31,"An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,32,"Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,33,She only shook her head at him.
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,34,Peter began to cry.
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,35,"Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,36,"Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water cans."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,37,"A white cat was staring at some goldfish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,38,"Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,39,"He went back towards the toolshed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe – scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,40,Peter scuttered underneath the bushes.
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,41,"But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,42,The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing his onions.
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,43,"His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,44,"Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,45,"Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,46,"He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,47,Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scarecrow to frighten blackbirds.
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,48,Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir tree.
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,49,"He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit hole, and shut his eyes."
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,50,His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,51,It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,52,I'm sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,53,"His mother put him to bed, and made some chamomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter!"
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,54,One tablespoonful to be taken at bedtime.
M36,THE TALE OF PETER RABBIT,BEATRIX POTTER,55,"But Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper."

M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,1,Once upon a time in Spain there was a little bull and his name was Ferdinand.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,2,"All the other little bulls he lived with would run and jump and butt their heads together, but not Ferdinand."
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,3,He liked to sit just quietly and smell the flowers.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,4,He had a favorite spot out in the pasture under a cork tree.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,5,It was his favorite tree and he would sit in its shade all day and smell the flowers.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,6,"Sometimes his mother, who was a cow, would worry about him."
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,7,She was afraid he would be lonesome all by himself.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,8,Why don't you run and play with the other little bulls and skip and butt your head? she would say.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,9,But Ferdinand would shake his head.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,10,I like it better here where I can sit just quietly and smell the flowers.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,11,"His mother saw that he was not lonesome, and because she was an understanding mother, even though she was a cow, she let him just sit there and be happy."
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,12,As the years went by Ferdinand grew and grew until he was very big and strong.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,13,All the other bulls who had grown up with him in the same pasture would fight each other all day.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,14,They would butt each other and stick each other with their horns.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,15,What they wanted most of all was to be picked to fight at the bull fights in Madrid.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,16,But not Ferdinand - he still liked to sit just quietly under the cork tree and smell the flowers.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,17,"One day five men came in very funny hats to pick the biggest, fastest, roughest bull to fight in the bull fights in Madrid."
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,18,"All the other bulls ran around snorting and butting, leaping and jumping so the men would think that they were very very strong and fierce and pick them."
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,19,Ferdinand knew that they wouldn't pick him and he didn't care.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,20,So he went out to his favorite cork tree to sit down.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,21,He didn't look where he was sitting and instead of sitting on the nice cool grass in the shade he sat on a bumble bee.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,22,"Well, if you were a bumble bee and a bull sat on you what would you do?"
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,23,You would sting him.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,24,And that is just what this bee did to Ferdinand.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,25,Wow!
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,26,Did it hurt!
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,27,Ferdinand jumped up with a snort.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,28,"He ran around puffing and snorting, butting and pawing the ground as if he were crazy."
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,29,The five men saw him and they all shouted with joy.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,30,Here was the largest and fiercest bull of all.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,31,Just the one for the bull fights in Madrid!
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,32,So they rook him away for the bull fight day in a cart.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,33,What a day it was!
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,34,"Flags were flying, bands were playing . . . and all the lovely ladies had flowers in their hair."
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,35,They had a parade into the bull ring.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,36,First came the Banderilleros with long sharp pins with ribbons on them to stick in the bull and make him mad.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,37,Next came the Picadores who rode skinny horses and they had long spears to stick in the bull and make him madder.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,38,"Then came the Matador, the proudest of all - he thought he was very handsome, and bowed to the ladies."
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,39,He had a red cape and a sword and was supposed to stick the bull last of all.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,40,"Then came the bull, and you know who that was don't you?"
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,41,Ferdinand.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,42,They called him Ferdinand the Fierce and all the Banderilleros were afraid of him and the Picadores were afraid of him and the Matador was scared stiff.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,43,Ferdinand ran to the middle of the ring and everyone shouted and clapped because they thought he was going to fight fiercely and butt and snort and stick his horns around.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,44,But not Ferdinand.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,45,When he got to the middle of the ring he saw the flowers in all the lovely ladies' hair and he just sat down quietly and smelled.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,46,He wouldn't fight and be fierce no matter what they did.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,47,He just sat and smelled.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,48,And the Banderilleros were mad and the Picadores were madder and the Matador was so mad he cried because he couldn't show off with his cape and sword.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,49,So they had to take Ferdinand home.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,50,"And for all I know he is sitting there still, under his favorite cork tree, smelling the flowers just quietly."
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,51,He is very happy.
M37,THE STORY OF FERDINAND,MUNRO LEAF,52,The end
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,1,A mother bird sat on her egg.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,2,The egg jumped.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,3,Oh oh! said the mother bird.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,4,My baby will be here!
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,5,He will want to eat.

M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,7,I will be back!
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,8,So away she went.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,9,The egg jumped.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,10,"It jumped, and jumped, and jumped!"
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,11,Out came the baby bird!
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,12,Where is my mother? he said.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,13,He looked for her.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,14,He looked up.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,15,He did not see her.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,16,He looked down.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,17,He did not see her.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,18,"I will go and look for her, he said."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,19,So away he went.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,20,"Down, out of the tree he went."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,21,"Down, down, down!"
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,22,It was a long way down.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,23,The baby bird could not fly.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,24,"He could not fly, but he could walk."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,25,"Now I will go and find my mother, he said."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,26,He did not know what his mother looked like.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,27,He went right by her.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,28,He did not see her.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,29,He came to a kitten.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,30,Are you my mother? he said to the kitten.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,31,The kitten just looked and looked.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,32,It did not say a thing.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,33,"The kitten was not his mother, so he went on."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,34,Then he came to a hen.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,35,Are you my mother? he said to the hen.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,36,"No, said the hen."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,37,The kitten was not his mother.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,38,The hen was not his mother.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,39,So the baby bird went on.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,40,I have to find my mother! he said.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,41,But where? Where is she? Where could she be?
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,42,Then he came to a dog.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,43,Are you my mother? he said to the dog.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,44,I am not your mother.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,45,"I am a dog, said the dog."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,46,The kitten was not his mother.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,47,The hen was not his mother.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,48,The dog was not his mother.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,49,So the baby bird went on.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,50,Now he came to a cow.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,51,Are you my mother? he said to the cow.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,52,How could I be your mother? said the cow.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,53,I am a cow.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,54,The kitten and the hen were not his mother.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,55,The dog and the cow were not his mother.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,56,Did he have a mother?
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,57,"I did have a mother, said the baby bird."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,58,I know I did.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,59,I have to find her.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,60,I will.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,61,I WILL!
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,62,Now the baby bird did not walk.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,63,He ran!
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,64,Then he saw a car.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,65,Could that old thing be his mother?
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,66,"No, it could not."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,67,The baby bird did not stop.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,68,He ran on and on.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,69,"Now he looked way, way down."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,70,He saw a boat.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,71,There she is! said the baby bird.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,72,"He called to the boat, but the boat did not stop."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,73,The boat went on.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,74,"He looked way, way up."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,75,He saw a big plane.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,76,"Here I am, Mother, he called out."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,77,But the plane did not stop.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,78,The plane went on.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,79,"Just then, the baby bird saw a big thing."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,80,This must be his mother!
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,81,There she is! he said.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,82,There is my mother!
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,83,He ran right up to it.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,84,"Mother, Mother! Here I am, Mother! he said to the big thing."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,85,"But the big thing just said, Snort."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,86,"Oh, you are not my mother, said the baby bird. You are a Snort."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,87,I have to get out of here!
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,88,But the baby bird could not get away.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,89,The Snort went up.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,90,"It went way, way up."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,91,"And up, up, up went the baby bird."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,92,"But now, where was the Snort going?"
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,93,"Oh, oh, oh!"
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,94,What is this Snort going to do to me?
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,95,Get me out of here!
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,96,"Just then, the Snort came to a stop."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,97,Where am I? said the baby bird.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,98,I want to go home!
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,99,I want a mother!
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,100,Then something happened.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,101,The Snort put that baby bird right back in the tree.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,102,The baby bird was home!
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,103,Just then the mother bird came back to the tree.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,104,Do you know who I am? she said to her baby.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,105,"Yes, I know who you are, said the baby bird."
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,106,You are not a kitten.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,107,You are not a hen.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,108,You are not a dog.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,109,You are not a cow.
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,110,"You are not a boat, or a plane, or a Snort!"
M38,ARE YOU MY MOTHER?,P.D. EASTMAN,111,"You are a bird, and you are my mother."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,1,The day she was born was the happiest day in her parents' lives.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,2,"She's perfect, said her mother."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,3,"Absolutely, said her father."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,4,And she was.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,5,She was absolutely perfect.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,6,"Her name must be everything she is, said her mother."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,7,"Her name must be absolutely perfect, said her father."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,8,And it was.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,9,Chrysanthemum.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,10,Her parents named her Chrysanthemum.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,11,Chrysanthemum grew and grew and grew.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,12,"And when she was old enough to appreciate it, Chrysanthemum loved her name."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,13,She loved the way it sounded when her mother woke her up.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,14,She loved the way it sounded when her father called her for dinner.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,15,And she loved the way it sounded when she whispered it to herself in the bathroom mirror.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,16,"Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,17,Chrysanthemum loved the way her name looked when it was written with ink on an envelope.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,18,She loved the way it looked when it was written with icing on her birthday cake.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,19,And she loved the way it looked when she wrote it herself with her fat orange crayon.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,20,"Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,21,Chrysanthemum thought her name was absolutely perfect.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,22,And then she started school.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,23,"On the first day, Chrysanthemum wore her sunniest dress and her brightest smile."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,24,She ran all the way.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,25,Hooray!  said Chrysanthemum.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,26,School!
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,27,"But when Mrs. Chud took roll call, everyone giggled upon hearing Chrysanthemum's name."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,28,"It's so long, said Jo."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,29,"It scarcely fits on your name tag, said Rita, pointing."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,30,"I'm named after my grandmother, said Victoria."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,31,You're named after a flower!
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,32,Chrysanthemum wilted.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,33,She did not think her name was absolutely perfect.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,34,She thought it was absolutely dreadful.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,35,The rest of the day was not much better.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,36,During naptime Victoria raised her hand and informed Mrs. Chud that Chrysanthemum's name was spelled with thirteen letters.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,37,That's exactly half as many letters as there are in the entire alphabet! Victoria explained.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,38,"Thank you for sharing that with us, Victoria, said Mrs. Chud."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,39,Now put your head down.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,40,"If I had a name like yours, I'd change it, Victoria said as the students lined up to go home."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,41,"I wish I could, thought Chrysanthemum miserably."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,42,Welcome home! said her mother.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,43,Welcome home! said her father.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,44,"School is no place for me, said Chrysanthemum."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,45,My name is too long.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,46,It scarcely fits on my name tag.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,47,And I'm named after a flower!
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,48,"Oh pish, said her mother."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,49,Your name is beautiful.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,50,"And her precious and priceless and fascinating and winsome, said her father."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,51,"It's everything you are, said her mother."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,52,"Absolutely perfect, said her father."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,53,Chrysanthemum felt much better after her favorite dinner (macaroni and cheese with ketchup) and an evening filled with hugs and kisses and Parcheesi.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,54,That night Chrysanthemum dreamed that her name was Jane.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,55,It was an extremely pleasant dream.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,56,The next morning Chrysanthemum wore her most comfortable jumper.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,57,She walked to school as slowly as she could.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,58,She dragged her feet in the dirt.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,59,"Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum, she wrote."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,60,"She even looks like a flower, said Victoria, as Chrysanthemum entered the playground."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,61,"Let's pick her, said Rita, pointing."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,62,"Let's smell her, said Jo."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,63,Chrysanthemum wilted.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,64,She did not think her name was absolutely perfect.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,65,She thought it was absolutely dreadful.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,66,The rest of the day was not much better.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,67,"During naptime Victoria raised her hand and said, A chrysanthemum is a flower."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,68,It lives in a garden with worms and other dirty things.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,69,"Thank you for sharing that with us, Victoria, said Mrs. Chud."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,70,Now put your head down.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,71,"I just cannot believe your name, Victoria said as the students lined up to go home."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,72,"Neither can I, thought Chrysanthemum miserably."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,73,'Welcome home! said her mother.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,74,'Welcome home! said her father.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,75,"School is no place for me, said Chrysanthemum."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,76,They said I even looked like a flower.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,77,They pretended to pick me and smell me.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,78,"Oh, pish, said her mother."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,79,They're just jealous.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,80,"And envious and begrudging and discontented and jaundiced, said her father."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,81,'Who wouldn't be jealous of a name like yours? said her mother.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,82,"After all, it's absolutely perfect, said her father."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,83,Chrysanthemum felt a trifle better after her favorite dessert (chocolate cake with buttercream frosting) and another evening filled with hugs and kisses and Parcheesi.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,84,That night Chrysanthemum dreamed that she really was a chrysanthemum.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,85,She sprouted leaves and petals.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,86,Victoria picked her and plucked the leaves and petals one by one until there was nothing left but a scrawny stem.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,87,It was the worst nightmare of Chrysanthemum's life.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,88,Chrysanthemum wore her outfit with seven pockets the next morning.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,89,She loaded the pockets with her most prized possessions and her good-luck charms.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,90,Chrysanthemum took the longest route possible to school.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,91,She stopped and stared at each and every flower.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,92,"Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum, the flowers seemed to say."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,93,"That morning the students were introduced to Mrs. Twinkle, the music teacher."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,94,"Her voice was like something out of a dream, as was everything else about her."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,95,The students were speechless.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,96,They thought Mrs. Twinkle was an indescribable wonder.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,97,They went out of their way to make a nice impression.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,98,Mrs. Twinkle led the students in scales.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,99,Then she assigned roles for the class musicale.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,100,Victoria was chosen as the dainty Fairy Queen.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,101,Rita was chosen as the spiffy Butterfly Princess.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,102,Jo was chosen as the all-important Pixie-messenger.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,103,And Chrysanthemum was chosen as a daisy.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,104,"Chrysanthemum's a daisy! Chrysanthemum's a daisy! Jo, Rita, and Victoria chanted, thinking it was wildly funny."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,105,Chrysanthemum wilted.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,106,She did not think her name was absolutely perfect.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,107,She thought it was absolutely dreadful.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,108,What's so humorous? asked Mrs. Twinkle.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,109,Chrysanthemum! was the answer.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,110,"Her name is so long, said Jo."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,111,"It scarcely fits on her name tag, said Rita, pointing."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,112,"I'm named after my grandmother, said Victoria."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,113,She's named after a flower!
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,114,"My name is long, said Mrs. Twinkle."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,115,It is? said Jo.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,116,"My name would scarcely fit on a name tag, said Mrs. Twinkle."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,117,"lt would? said Rita, pointing."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,118,"And- said Mrs. Twinkle, l'm named after a flower, too!"
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,119,You are? said Victoria.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,120,"Yes, said Mrs. Twinkle."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,121,My name is Delphinium.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,122,Delphinium Twinkle.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,123,"And if my baby is a girl, I'm considering Chrysanthemum as a name."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,124,I think it is absolutely perfect.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,125,Chrysanthemum could scarcely believe her ears.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,126,She blushed.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,127,She beamed.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,128,She bloomed.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,129,"Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum, Chrysanthemum."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,130,"Jo, Rita, and Victoria looked at Chrysanthemum longingly."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,131,"Call me Marigold, said Jo."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,132,"I'm Carnation, said Rita, pointing."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,133,"My name is Lily of the Valley, said Victoria."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,134,Chrysanthemum did not think her name was absolutely perfect.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,135,She knew it!
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,136,EPILOGUE:
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,137,"Overall, the class musical was a huge success."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,138,Chrysanthemum was absolutely perfect as a daisy.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,139,Victoria made the only mistake: She completely forgot her lines as the dainty Fuity Queen.
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,140,"Chrysanthemum thought it was wildly funny, and she giggled throughout the entire Dance of the Flowers."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,141,"Eventually, Mrs. Twinkle gave birth to a healthy baby girl."
M39,CHRYSANTHEMUM,KEVIN HENKES,142,"And, of course, she named her Chrysanthemum."

M40,DRAGONS LOVE TACOS,ADAM RUBIN,29,Maybe it's the comforting sound of a good friend's laughter.
M40,DRAGONS LOVE TACOS,ADAM RUBIN,30,"The only thing dragons love more than parties or tacos, is taco parties (taco parties are parties with lots of tacos)."

M40,DRAGONS LOVE TACOS,ADAM RUBIN,47,You didn't read the fine print?!
M40,DRAGONS LOVE TACOS,ADAM RUBIN,48,"Dragons, listen to me: Do not eat those tacos."

M40,DRAGONS LOVE TACOS,ADAM RUBIN,58,Maybe they're just in it for the taco breaks.
M40,DRAGONS LOVE TACOS,ADAM RUBIN,59,"After all, dragons love tacos."

M41,LITTLE BLUE TRUCK LEADS THE WAY,ALICE SCHERTLE,34,Then he gave a cough and his engine died.
M41,LITTLE BLUE TRUCK LEADS THE WAY,ALICE SCHERTLE,35,He was stuck right there with the mayor inside.

M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,32,Except when you don't.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,33,"Because, sometimes, you won't."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,34,"I'm sorry to say so but, sadly, it's true that Bang-ups and Hang-ups can happen to you."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,35,You can get all hung up in a prickle-ly perch.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,36,And your gang will fly on.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,37,You'll be left in a Lurch.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,38,You'll come down from the Lurch with an unpleasant bump.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,39,"And the chances are, then, that you'll be in Slump."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,40,"And when you're in a Slump, you're not in for much fun."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,41,Un-slumping yourself is not easily done.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,42,You will come to a place where the streets are not marked.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,43,Some windows are lighted.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,44,Bur mostly they're darked.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,45,A place you could sprain both your elbow and chin!
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,46,Do you dare to stay out?

M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,50,"And IF you go in, should you turn left or right. . .  or right-and-three-quarters?"
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,51,"Or, maybe, not quite?"
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,52,Or go around back and sneak in from behind?
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,53,"Simple it's not, I'm afraid you will find, for a mind-maker-upper to make up his mind."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,54,"You can get so confused that you'll start in to race down long wiggled roads at a break-necking pace and grind on for miles across weirdish wild space, headed, I fear, toward a most useless place."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,55,The Waiting Place. . .  for people just waiting.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,56,"Waiting for a train to go or a bus to come, or a plane to go or the mail to come, or the rain to go or the phone to ring, or the snow to snow or waiting around for a yes or No or waiting for their hair to grow."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,57,Everyone is just waiting.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,58,"Waiting for the fish to bite or waiting for wind to fly a kite or waiting around for Friday night or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake or a pot to boil, or a Better Break or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants or a wig with curls, or Another Chance."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,59,Everyone is just waiting.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,60,NO!

M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,73,"You'll be famous as famous can be, with the whole wide world watching you win on TV."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,74,Except when they don't.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,75,"Because, sometimes, they won't."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,76,I'm afraid that some times you'll play lonely games too.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,77,Games you can't win 'cause you'll play against you.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,78,All alone!
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,79,"Whether you like it or not, alone will be something you'll be quite a lot."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,80,"And when you're alone, there's a very good chance you'll meet things that scare you right out of your pants."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,81,"There are some, down the road between hither and yon, that can scare you so much you won't want to go on."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,82,But on you will go though the weather be foul.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,83,On you will go though your enemies prowl.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,84,On you will go though the Hakken-Kraks howl.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,85,"Onward up many a frightening creek, though your arms may get sore and your sneakers may leak."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,86,On and on you will hike.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,87,And I know you'll hike far and face up to your problems whatever they are.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,88,"You'll get mixed up, of course, as you already know."
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,89,You'll get mixed up with many strange birds as you go.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,90,So be sure when you step.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,91,Step with care and great tact and remember that Life's a Great Balancing Act.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,92,Just never forget to be dexterous and deft.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,93,And never mix up your right foot with your left.
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,94,And will you succeed?
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,95,Yes!
M43,"OH, THE PLACES YOU'LL GO",DR. SEUSS,96,"You will, indeed!"

M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,1,"Chug, chug, chug."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,2,"Puff, puff, puff."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,3,"Ding-dong, ding-dong."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,4,The little train rumbled over the tracks.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,5,She was a happy little train for she had such a jolly load to carry.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,6,Her cars were filled full of good things for boys and girls.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,7,"There were toy animals-giraffes with long necks, Teddy bears with almost no necks at all, and even a baby elephant."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,8,"Then there were dolls-dolls with blue eyes and yellow curls, dolls with brown eyes and brown bobbed heads, and the funniest little toy clown you ever saw."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,9,"And there were cars full of toy engines, airplanes, tops, jack-knives, picture puzzles, books, and every kind of thing boys or girls could want."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,10,But that was not all.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,11,"Some of the cars were filled with all sorts of good things for boys and girls to eat-big golden oranges, red-cheeked apples, bottles of creamy milk for their breakfasts, fresh spinach for their dinners, peppermint drops, and lollypops for after-meal treats."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,12,The little train was carrying all these wonderful things to the good little boys and girls on the other side of the mountain.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,13,She puffed along merrily.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,14,"Here comes a shiny new engine, said the funny little clown who jumped out of the train."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,15,Let us ask him to help us.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,16,So all the dolls and toys cried out together:
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,17,"Please, Shiny New Engine, wont you please pull our train over the mountain?"
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,18,"Our engine has broken down, and the boys and girls on the other side wont have any toys to play with or good food to eat unless you help us."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,19,But the Shiny New Engine snorted: l pull you?
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,20,I am a Passenger Engine.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,21,"I have just carried a fine big train over the mountain, with more cars than you ever dreamed of."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,22,"My train had sleeping cars, with comfortable berths; a dining-car where waiters bring whatever hungry people want to eat; and parlor cars in which people sit in soft arm-chairs and look out of big plate-glass windows."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,23,I pull the likes of you?
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,24,Indeed not!
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,25,"And off he steamed to the roundhouse, where engines live when they are not busy."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,26,How sad the little train and all the dolls and toys felt!
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,27,"Then the little clown called out, The Passenger Engine is not the only one in the world."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,28,"Here is another engine coming, a great big strong one."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,29,Let us ask him to help us.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,30,The little toy clown waved his flag and the big strong engine came to a stop.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,31,"Please, oh, please, Big Engine, cried all the dolls and toys together."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,32,Won't you please pull our train over the mountain?
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,33,"Our engine has broken down, and the good little boys and girls on the other side won't have any toys to play with or good food to eat unless you help us."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,34,But the Big Strong Engine bellowed: I am a Freight Engine.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,35,I have just pulled a big train loaded with big machines over the mountain.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,36,These machines print books and newspapers for grown-ups to read.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,37,I am a very important engine indeed.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,38,I wont pull the likes of you!
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,39,And the Freight Engine puffed off indignantly to the roundhouse.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,40,The little train and all the dolls and toys were very sad.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,41,"Cheer up, cried the little toy clown."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,42,The Freight Engine is not the only one in the world.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,43,Here comes another.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,44,"He looks very old and tired, but our train is so little, perhaps he can help us."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,45,"So the little toy clown waved his flag and the dingy, rusty old engine stopped."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,46,"Please, kind Engine, cried all the dolls and toys together."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,47,Won't you please pull our train over the mountain?
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,48,"Our engine has broken down, and the boys and girls on the other side won't have any toys to play with or good food to eat unless you help us."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,49,But the Rusty Old Engine sighed: I am so tired.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,50,I must rest my weary wheels.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,51,I cannot pull even so little a train as yours over the mountain.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,52,I can not.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,53,I can not.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,54,I can not.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,55,"Then indeed the little train was very, very sad, and the dolls and toys were ready to cry."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,56,"But the little clown called out, Here is another engine coming, a little blue engine, a very little one, maybe she will help us."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,57,"The very little engine came chug, chugging merrily along."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,58,"When she saw the toy clown's flag, she stopped quickly."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,59,"What is the matter, my friends? she asked kindly."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,60,"Oh, Little Blue Engine, cried the dolls and toys."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,61,Will you pull us over the mountain?
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,62,"Our engine has broken down and the good boys and girls on the other side won't have any toys to play with or good food to eat, unless you help us."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,63,"Please, please, help us, Little Blue Engine."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,64,"She tugged and pulled and pulled and tugged and slowly, slowly, slowly they started off."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,65,The toy clown jumped aboard and all the dolls and the toy animals began to smile and cheer.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,66,"Puff, puff, chug, chug, went the Little Blue Engine."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,67,I think I can
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,68,I think I can
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,69,I think I can
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,70,I think I can
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,71,I think I can
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,72,I think I can
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,73,I think I can
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,74,I think I can
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,75,I think I can.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,76,"Up, up, up."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,77,"Faster and faster and faster and faster the little engine climbed, until at last they reached the top of the mountain."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,78,Down in the valley lay the city.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,79,"Hurray, hurray, cried the funny little clown and all the dolls and toys."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,80,"The good little boys and girls in the city will be happy because you helped us, kind, Little Blue Engine."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,81,"And the Little Blue Engine smiled and seemed to say as she puffed steadily down the mountain, I thought I could."
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,82,I thought I could.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,83,I thought I could.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,84,I thought I could.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,85,I thought I could.
M44,THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD,WATTY PIPER,86,I thought I could.

M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,1,This is George.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,2,He lived in the Zoo.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,3,He was a good little monkey and always very curious.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,4,He wanted to find out what was going on outside the Zoo.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,5,"One day, when the keeper was not paying attention, George got hold of the key for the cage."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,6,"When the keeper discovered what had happened, it was too late- George was gone!"
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,7,WHERE WAS GEORGE?
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,8,They looked for him everywhere.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,9,But they could not find him.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,10,"George was hiding in the hay of his friend, the elephant."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,11,Finally the keepers gave up looking for him.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,12,"George found a nice cozy spot to sleep under the elephant's right ear, and the next morning, before the zoo opened, he got away safely."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,13,Once on the street George felt a little scared.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,14,What should he do in the big city?
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,15,"Maybe he could find his friend, the man with the yellow hat, who had brought him over from Africa a long time ago."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,16,Only George did not know where he lived.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,17,There was a bus stopping at the corner.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,18,George had never ridden on one.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,19,"Quickly he climbed a lamp post, jumped on top of the bus and off they went."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,20,Now they were right at the center of the town.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,21,There was so much to see that George did not know where to look first.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,22,If only he could go on riding this forever!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,23,But after a while George got tired and a little dizzy.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,24,"When the bus slowed down to turn into a side street, George jumped off."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,25,There was a restaurant right in front of him.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,26,Mmmm- something smelled good!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,27,Suddenly George felt very hungry.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,28,The kitchen door stood open and George walked in.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,29,On the table was a big pot.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,30,Of course George was curious.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,31,He had to find out what was in it. . .
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,32,When the cook came back he had a big surprise.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,33,Spaghetti was all over the place and in the middle of it was a little monkey.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,34,George had been eating yards and yards and had wound himself all up in it.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,35,The cook was a kind man and did not scold much.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,36,But George had to clean up the kitchen and then do all the dishes.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,37,"My, what a lot of them there were!"
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,38,The cook was watching George.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,39,"You are lucky to have four hands,  he said"
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,40,You can do things twice as quickly.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,41,I have a friend who could use a handy little fellow like you to wash windows.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,42,"If you would like to, I will take you over to him."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,43,"So they went down into the subway and took an uptown train to the cook's friend, who was an elevator man in a skyscraper."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,44,"Sure, I cam use you! the elevator man said to George."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,45,I will give you what you need for the job.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,46,You can start right away.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,47,But remember- you are here for washing windows.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,48,Never mind what people inside the house are doing.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,49,Don't be curious or you'll get into trouble.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,50,"George promised to be good, but little monkeys sometimes forget. . ."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,51,George was ready to start.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,52,"My, how many windows there were!"
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,53,"But George got ahead quickly, since he worked with all four hands."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,54,He jumped from window to window just as he had jumped from tree to tree in the African jungle.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,55,For a while George stuck to his work and did not pay any attention to the people inside.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,56,"Of course he was curious, but he remembered his promise."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,57,In one room a little boy was crying because he did not want to eat his spinach.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,58,George did not even look but went on with his work.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,59,In another room a man was taking a nap and snoring.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,60,"George was sorry it was not his friend, the man with the yellow hat."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,61,"He listened to the funny noise for a while, then went on working."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,62,But what was going on here?
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,63,George stopped working and pressed his nose against the window.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,64,Two painters were working inside.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,65,George was fascinated.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,66,Painting looked like a lot more fun than washing windows!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,67,The painters were ready to go out for lunch.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,68,The minute they left George climbed inside.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,69,What wonderful paints and brushes they had!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,70,George could not resist. . .
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,71,An hour later the painters came back.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,72,They opened the door- and stood with their mouths wide open.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,73,The whole room had changed to a jungle with palm trees all over the walls and a giraffe and two leopards and a zebra.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,74,And a little monkey was busy painting himself on one of the trees!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,75,Then the painters knew what had happened!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,76,Luckily George was close to a door.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,77,He ran out as fast as he could.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,78,"After him ran the two painters, then the elevator man and then the woman who lived in the place."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,79,"Oh, my lovely room, my lovely room! cried the woman."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,80,Don't let him her away!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,81,George headed for the fire escape.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,82,George reached the end of the fire escape.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,83,The others had not caught up with him yet.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,84,Here was his chance.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,85,They could not jump!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,86,But George could easily jump down and escape.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,87,In a moment he would be safe!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,88,Poor little George!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,89,He had forgotten that the pavement was hard as stone. . .  not like the soft grass of the jungle.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,90,Too bad!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,91,The fall broke his leg and an ambulance came to take George to the hospital.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,92,"He got what he deserved! said the woman making my apartment into a jungle, indeed!"
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,93,"I told him he would get into trouble, the elevator man added."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,94,He was too curious.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,95,George had to lie in bed with his leg high up in a plaster cast.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,96,He was very unhappy.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,97,And it had all started out so nicely!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,98,If only he had not been so curious he could have had a lot of fun.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,99,Now it was too late. . .
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,100,"But the next morning George's friend, the man with the big yellow hat, was buying a newspaper."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,101,Suddenly he got very excited.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,102,This is George! he shouted when he saw the picture on the front page.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,103,Quickly he read the whole story and then ran to a telephone booth to ring a hospital.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,104,"I am George's friend, he said to the nurse who answered the telephone."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,105,Please take good care of him so that he will get better quickly.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,106,I want to take him to a movie studio and make a picture about his life in the jungle.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,107,Don't let him get into any more mischief until I can take him away.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,108,Finally the day came when George could walk again.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,109,Your friend is going to take you away this morning said the nurse.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,110,Just wait right here for him and don't touch anything!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,111,As soon as George was alone he looked around at the strange hospital things.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,112,"I wonder what is in that big blue bottle,  he thought."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,113,And this is how the man with the yellow hat found George when he came to call for him!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,114,They picked him up and shook him but they could not wake him up.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,115,He was so fast asleep that finally they had to put him UNDER THE SHOWER!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,116,How surprised his was when he woke up!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,117,"George said goodbye to the nurse and the kind doctor,"
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,118,Then he and the man with the yellow hat got into the car to drive to the movie studio.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,119,In the president's office George had to sign a contract.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,120,Now he was a movie actor!
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,121,"In the studio George was kept so busy all the time that he forgot to be curious,"
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,122,He liked the jungle they made for him and played happily there.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,123,And when the movie was finally finished George invited all his friends to see it: the doctor and the nurse and the ambulance driver and the man from the newsstand and the woman and the elevator man and the two painters and the cook and the reporter and all the keepers of the Zoo.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,124,Now the lights went out and the picture started.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,125,"This is George, the voice began."
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,126,He lived in the jungle.
M49,CURIOUS GEORGE TAKES A JOB,H.A. RAY,127,He was a good little monkey- he had only one fault: he was too curious.

M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,1,"One day down on the farm, Duck got a wild idea."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,2,I bet I could ride a bike! he thought.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,3,"He waddled over to where the boy parked his bike, climbed on, and began to ride."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,4,"At first he rode very slowly, and he wobbled a lot, but it was fun."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,5,Duck rode past Cow and waved to her.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,6,"'Hello, Cow! said Duck."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,7,"M-o-o-o, said Cow."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,8,"But what she thought was, A duck on a bike?"
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,9,That's the silliest thing I've ever seen!
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,10,Then Duck rode past Sheep.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,11,"Hello, Sheep! said Duck."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,12,"B-a-a-a, said Sheep."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,13,"But what she thought was, He's going to hurt himself if he's not careful!"
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,14,Duck was riding better now.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,15,He rode past Dog.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,16,"Hello, Dog! said Duck."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,17,Woof! said Dog.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,18,"But what he thought was, That is a mighty neat trick!"
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,19,Then Duck rode past Cat.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,20,"Hello, Cat! said Duck."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,21,"Meow, said Cat."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,22,"But what she thought was, I wouldn't waste my time riding a bike!"
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,23,Duck pedaled a little faster.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,24,He rode past Horse.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,25,"Hello, Horse! said Duck."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,26,Ne-e-e-igh! said Horse.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,27,"But what he though was, You're still not as fast as me, Duck!"
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,28,Duck rang his bell as he rode toward chicken.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,29,"Hello, Chicken! said Duck."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,30,Cluck! Cluck! said Chicken.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,31,"But what she thought was, Watch where you're going, Duck!"
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,32,Then Duck rode past Goat.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,33,"Hello, Goat! said Duck."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,34,"M-a-a-a, Said Goat."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,35,"But what he thought was, I'd like to eat that bike!"
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,36,Duck stood on the seat and rode past Pig and Pig.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,37,"Hello, Pigs! said Duck."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,38,Oink said Pig and Pig.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,39,"But what they thought was, Duck is such a show-off!"
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,40,Then Duck rode no-hands past Mouse.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,41,"Hello, Mouse! said Duck."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,42,"Squeak, said Mouse."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,43,"But what he thought was, I wish I could ride a bike just like Duck."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,44,"Suddenly, a whole bunch of kids came down the road on bikes."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,45,They were in such a hurry that they didn't see Duck.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,46,They parked their bikes by the house and went inside.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,47,Now all the animals had bikes!
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,48,They rode around and around the barnyard.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,49,This is fun! they all said.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,50,"Good idea, Duck!"
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,51,Then they put the bikes back by the house.
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,52,"And no one knew that on that afternoon, there had been a cow, a sheep, a dog, a cat, a horse, a chicken, a goat, two pigs, a mouse, and a duck on a bike."
M52,DUCK ON A BIKE,DAVID SHANNON,53,The End
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,1,"Harry was a white dog with black spots who liked everything, except . . . getting a bath."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,2,"So one day when he heard the water running in the tub, he took the scrubbing brush . . . and buried it in the backyard."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,3,Then he ran away from home.
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,4,He played where they were fixing the street and got very dirty.
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,5,He played at the railroad and got even dirtier.
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,6,He played tag with other dogs and became dirtier still.
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,7,He slid down a coal chute and got the dirtiest of all.
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,8,"In fact, he changed from a white dog with black spots to a black dog with white spots."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,9,"Although there were many other things to do, Harry began to wonder if his family thought that he had really run away."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,10,"He felt tired and hungry too, so without stopping on the way he ran back home."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,11,"When Harry got to his house, he crawled through the fence and sat looking at the back door."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,12,"One of the family looked out and said, There's a strange dog in the backyard . . . by the way, has anyone seen Harry?"
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,13,"When Harry heard this, he tired very hard to show them he was Harry."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,14,"He started to do all his old, clever tricks."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,15,He flip-flopped and he flop-flipped.
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,16,He rolled over and played dead.
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,17,He danced and he sang.
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,18,"He did these tricks over and over again, but everyone shook their heads and said, Oh no, it couldn't be Harry."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,19,"Harry gave up and walked slowly toward the gate, but suddenly he stopped."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,20,He ran to a corner of the garden and started to dog furiously.
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,21,"Soon he jumped away from the hole barking short, happy barks."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,22,He's found the scrubbing brush!
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,23,"And carrying it in his mouth, he ran into the house."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,24,"He jumped into the bathtub and sat up begging, with the scrubbing brush in his mouth, a trick he certainly had never done before."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,25,"This little doggie wants a bath! cried the little girl, and her father said, Why don't you and your brother give him one?"
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,26,Harry's bath was the soapiest one he'd ever had.
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,27,It worked like magic.
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,28,"As soon as the children started to scrub, they began shouting, Mummy! Daddy! Look, look! Come quick!"
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,29,It's Harry! It's Harry! It's Harry! they cried.
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,30,"Harry wagged his tail and was very, very happy."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,31,"His family combed and brushed him lovingly, and he became once again a white dog with black spots."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,32,It was wonderful to be home.
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,33,"After dinner, Harry fell asleep in his favorite place, happily dreaming of how much fun it had been getting dirty."
M53,HARRY THE DIRTY DOG,GENE ZION,34,"He slept so soundly, he didn't even feel the scrubbing brush he'd hidden under his pillow."

M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,20,He thought that desks in rows were old-fashioned and boring.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,21,Do you rodents think you can handle a semicircle?
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,22,And he always provided the most tasty snacks-things that were curly and crunchy and cheesy.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,23,"I want to be a teacher when I grow up, said Lilly."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,24,"Me, too! said her friends Chester and Wilson and Victor."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,25,At home Lilly pretended to be Mr. Slinger.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,26,"I am the teacher, she told her baby brother, Julius."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,27,Listen up!
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,28,Lilly even wanted her own set of deluxe picture encyclopedias.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,29,Teachers know everything!
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,30,What's with Lilly? asked her mother.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,31,"I thought she wanted to be a surgeon or an ambulance driver or a diva, said her father."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,32,"It must be because of her new teacher, Mr. Slinger, said her mother."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,33,"Wow, said he father."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,34,That was just about all he could say.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,35,Wow.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,36,"Whenever the students had free time, they were permitted to go to the Lightbulb Lab in the back of the classroom."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,37,They expressed their ideas creatively through drawing and writing.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,38,Lilly went often.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,39,She had a lot of ideas.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,40,She drew pictures of Mr. Slinger.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,41,"And she wrote stories about him, too."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,42,"During Sharing Time, Lilly showed her creations to the entire class."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,43,"Wow, said Mr. Slinger."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,44,That was just about all he could say.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,45,Wow.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,46,Big Friendly Mr. Nice Man Teacher!
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,47,"And at the very last second Mr. Slinger saved the cold, starving, elderly . . ."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,48,"When Mr. Slinger had bus duty, Lilly stood in line even though she didn't ride the bus."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,49,Lilly raised her hand more than anyone else in class (even if she didn't know the answer).
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,50,Call on me!
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,51,Please!
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,52,Please!
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,53,And she volunteered to stay after school to clap erasers.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,54,"I want to be a teacher when I grow up, said Lilly."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,55,"Excellent choice, said Mr. Slinger."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,56,One Monday morning Lilly came to school especially happy.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,57,She had gone shopping with her Grammy over the weekend.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,58,"Lilly had a new pair of movie star sunglasses, complete with glittery diamonds and a chain like Mr. Slinger's."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,59,She had three shiny quarters.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,60,"And, best of all, she had a brand new purple plastic purse that played a jaunty tune when it was opened."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,61,Lilly wanted to show everyone.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,62,"Not now, said Mr. Slinger."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,63,Listen to our story.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,64,Lilly had a hard time listening.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,65,Lilly really wanted to show everyone.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,66,"Not now, said Mr. Slinger."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,67,Let's be considerate of our classmates.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,68,Lilly had a hard time being considerate.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,69,"Lilly really, really wanted to show everyone."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,70,"Not now, said Mr. Slinger."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,71,Wait until recess or Sharing Time.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,72,But Lilly could not wait.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,73,She's in trouble.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,74,The glasses were so glittery.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,75,The quarters were so shiny.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,76,"And the purse played such nice music, not to mention how excellent it was for storing school supplies."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,77,"Look, Lilly whispered fiercely."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,78,"Look, everyone."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,79,Look what I've got!
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,80,Everyone looked.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,81,Including Mr. Slinger.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,82,He was not amused.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,83,"I'll just keep your things at my desk until the end of the day, said Mr. Slinger."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,84,"They'll be safe there, and then you can take them home."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,85,Lilly's stomach lurched.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,86,She felt like crying.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,87,Her glasses were gone.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,88,Her quarters wert gone.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,89,Her purple plastic Purse was gone.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,90,Lilly longed for her purse all morning.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,91,She was even too sad to eat the snack Mr. Slinger served before recess.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,92,That afternoon Lilly went to the Lightbulb Lab.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,93,She was still very sad.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,94,She thought and she thought and she thought.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,95,And then she became angry.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,96,She thought and she thought and she thought some more.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,97,And then she became furious.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,98,She thought and she thought and she thought a bit longer.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,99,And then she drew a picture of Mr. Slinger.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,100,Big Fat Mean Mr. Stealing Teacher!
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,101,Bad

M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,106,P.S. I do not want to be a teacher when I grow up!
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,107,"Right before the last bell rang, Lilly sneaked the drawing into Mr. Slinger's book bag."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,108,"When all the students were buttoned and zipped and snapped and tied and ready to go home, Mr. Slinger strolled over to Lilly and gave her purple plastic purse back."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,109,"It's a beautiful purse, said Mr. Slinger."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,110,Your quarters are nice and jingly.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,111,And those glasses are absolutely fabulous.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,112,You may bring them back to school as long as you don't disturb the rest of the class.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,113,"I do not want to be a teacher when I grow up, Lilly said as she marched out of the classroom."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,114,On the way home Lilly opened her purse.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,115,Her glasses and quarters were inside.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,116,And so was a note from Mr. Slinger.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,117,It said: Today was a difficult day.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,118,Tomorrow will be better.'
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,119,There was also a small bag of tasty snacks at the bottom of the purse.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,120,Lilly's stomach lurched.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,121,She felt like crying.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,122,She felt simply awful.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,123,Lilly ran all the way home and told her mother and father everything.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,124,"Instead of watching her favorite cartoons, Lilly decided to sit in the uncooperative chair."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,125,I'll stay here a million years for Mr. Slinger.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,126,Why does everything always happen to me?
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,127,"One thousand fifty-one, one thousand fifty-two, one thousand ninety-nine . . ."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,128,"That night Lilly drew a new picture of Mr. Slinger and wrote a story about him, too."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,129,Lilly was really really sorry.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,130,So everyone forgave her.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,131,Even her parents.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,132,Even her stinky baby brother.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,133,Even her especially incredible teacher.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,134,And then the sun shined its smiley face down on everyone and everything.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,135,Even the bugs and the worms.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,136,The end

M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,149,What does it say?
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,150,Lilly's mother wrote a note.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,151,And Lilly's father baked some tasty snacks for Lilly to take to school the next day.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,152,"I think Mr. Slinger will understand, said Lilly's mother."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,153,"I know he will, said Lilly's father."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,154,The next morning Lilly got to school early.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,155,"These are for you, Lilly said to Mr. Slinger."

M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,166,What do you think we should do with this? asked Mr. Slinger.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,167,Could we just throw it away? asked Lilly.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,168,"Excellent idea, said Mr. Slinger."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,169,It's like having an extra pocket with a radio inside!
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,170,Three quarters are even better than a dollar bill because they make noise!
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,171,Glamorous protection from harmful rays!
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,172,"During sharing Time, Lilly demonstrated the many uses and unique qualities of her purple plastic purse, her shiny quarters, and her glittery movie star sunglasses."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,173,Then she did a little performance using them as props.
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,174,"It's called Interpretive Dance, said Lilly."
M55,LILLY'S PURPLE PLASTIC PURSE,KEVIN HENKES,175,Mr. Slinger joined in.

M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,24,"There was an old woman who swallowed a fly, Ostrich began."
M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,25,Charley started laughing.
M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,26,She swallowed a dog to catch the cat! Ostrich read.
M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,27,Now everyone was laughing!
M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,28,Woof-woof!
M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,29,Ha-ha-ha!
M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,30,Meow!
M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,31,They were still laughing when they checked out their book and went outside to play.
M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,32,"In the park, Cyril and Charley pretended to be the old woman and her dog."
M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,33,Woof-woof!
M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,34,"Tallulah meowed like a cat, and Eddie neighed like a horse."
M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,35,Meow!
M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,36,Neigh!
M57,MAISY GOES TO THE LIBRARY,LUCY COUSINS,37,"And Maisy read her sparkly book about fish in a nice, quiet place."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,1,This is Olivia.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,2,She is good at lot of things.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,3,She is very good at wearing people out.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,4,She even wears herself out.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,5,Olivia has a little brother named Ian.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,6,He's always copying.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,7,"Sometimes Ian just won't leave her alone, so Olivia has to be firm."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,8,"Olivia lives with her mother, her father, her brother, her dog, Percy, and Edwin, the cat."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,9,"In the morning, after she gets up, and moves the cat, and brushes her teeth, and combs her ears, and moves the cat, Olivia gets dressed."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,10,She has to try on everything.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,11,"On sunny days, Olivia likes to go to the beach."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,12,She feels it's important to come prepared.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,13,"Last summer when Olivia was little, her mother showed her how to make sandcastles."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,14,She got pretty good.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,15,Sometimes Olivia likes to bask in the sun.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,16,"When her mother sees that she's had enough, they go home."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,17,Every day Olivia is supposed to take a nap.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,18,"It's time for your you-know-what, her mother says."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,19,Of course Olivia's not at all sleepy.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,20,"On rainy days, Olivia likes to go to the museum."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,21,She heads straight for her favorite picture.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,22,Olivia looks at it for a long time.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,23,What could she be thinking?
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,24,But there is one painting Olivia just doesn't get.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,25,"I could do that in about five minutes, she says to her mother."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,26,As soon as she gets home she gives it a try.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,27,Time out.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,28,"After a nice bath, and a nice dinner, it's time for bed."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,29,But of course Olivia's not at all sleepy.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,30,"Only five books tonight, Mommy, she says."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,31,"No, Olivia, just one."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,32,How about four?
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,33,Two.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,34,Three.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,35,"Oh, all right, three. But that's it!"
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,36,"When they've finished reading, Olivia's mother gives her a kiss and says, You know, you really wear me out."
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,37,But I love you anyway.
M58,OLIVIA,IAN FALCONER,38,"And Olivia gives her a kiss back and says, I love you anyway too."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,1,There was trouble in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in Bear Country- trouble with manners.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,2,The Bear family's trouble with manners was that they forgot them!
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,3,At first it was just an occasional please or thank you that was forgotten.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,4,Then there was a rude push without an excuse me.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,5,Then a reach across the table instead of a please pass the broccoli.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,6,Mama Bear wasn't quite sure how or why it happened.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,7,"But she was sure of one thing– whatever the reason, the Bear family had become a pushing, shoving, name-calling, ill-mannered mess!"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,8,Sillyhead!
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,9,Fuzzbrain!
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,10,Noodlepuss!
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,11,At the table it was even worse.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,12,"They were a grabbing, mouth-stuffing, food-fighting, kicking-under-the-table super mess!"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,13,"Of course, Mama Bear tried to correct Brother and Sister Bear's behavior."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,14,She tried coaxing.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,15,She tried complaining.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,16,She tried shouting!
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,17,She tried going to Papa for help (though it sometimes seemed to Mama that he was part of the problem).
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,18,Papa banged on the table and shouted as only he could shout.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,19,But nothing really seemed to do any good.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,20,Mama didn't like what was happening to her family.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,21,Not one bit.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,22,Something had to be done.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,23,But what?
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,24,"The best way to fight bad habits, she thought, was with good habits."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,25,Then she thought of a plan.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,26,She got a big piece of cardboard and a marker.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,27,At the top she wrote: THE BEAR FAMILY POLITENESS PLAN.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,28,"When the plan was finished, she called a family meeting and showed it to papa and the cubs."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,29,It certainly got the Bear family's attention!
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,30,The bear family politeness plan
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,31,Rudeness
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,32,Penalty
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,33,Forgetting Please or thank you . . . sweep front steps
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,34,Pushing or shoving . . . beat two rugs
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,35,Interrupting . . . dust downstairs
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,36,Name calling . . . clean cellar
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,37,Reaching at table . . . clean yard
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,38,Playing with food . . . wash dishes
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,39,Rude noises . . . weed garden
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,40,Banging door . . . clean attic
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,41,Forgetting excuse me . . . empty garbage
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,42,Hogging bathroom . . . put out trash
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,43,Mama's plan had a list of all the rude things she wanted to stop.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,44,Beside each one was a penalty-a job or chore that went with it.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,45,"If you forgot a please or a thank you, you had to sweep the front steps."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,46,"If you pushed or shoved, you had to beat two rugs."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,47,"If you got caught name-calling, you had to clean the whole cellar!"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,48,"But, Mama! sputtered the cubs."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,49,You're not being fair!
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,50,"It seems to me, she said, that you're the ones who aren't being fair-to yourselves or anyone else."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,51,That's what manners are all about-being fair and considerate.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,52,Manners are very important.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,53,They help us get along with each other.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,54,"Why, without manners-"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,55,Your mama's absolutely right! interrupted Papa.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,56,"Thank you, Papa, for your comment."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,57,"But interrupting is number three on the Rude List, and the penalty is dusting the downstairs, Mama said, and handed him the feather duster."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,58,"Hmm, said Brother."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,59,This looks serious.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,60,I think we'd better come up with a plan of our own or we're going to be doing a lot of extra chores.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,61,What sort of plan? asked Sister.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,62,"Well, he said, instead of just being polite, we'll be super polite."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,63,We'll 'please' and 'thank you' so much that Mama will get fed up and call the whole thing off!
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,64,"Yes, said Sister."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,65,"We'll be so polite, she won't be able to stand it!"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,66,They put their plan into action.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,67,They were super polite. . .
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,68,-On the stairs:
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,69,"After you, Sister dear!"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,70,"Thank you, dear Brother!"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,71,-In the hall:
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,72,"Excuse me, Brother dear!"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,73,"Why, certainly, my dear Sister!"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,74,-Waiting for the bathroom:
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,75,Terribly sorry to have kept you waiting!
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,76,"Think nothing of it, my dear!"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,77,But it didn't work the way they expected.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,78,Mama didn't get fed up at all.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,79,And after a while Brother and Sister forgot about being super polite and were just polite. . .
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,80,-At the table:
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,81,"Pass the honey, please."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,82,Certainly.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,83,-In their room:
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,84,Would you like me to help you pick up your toys?
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,85,Thank you very much.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,86,-in the yard:
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,87,Oops! Sorry-I didn't mean to bump you.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,88,That's all right.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,89,No harm done.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,90,And it turned out that Mama had been right: things did go more smoothly.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,91,"Once they got into the good manners habit, they didn't even have to think about it."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,92,But it wasn't so easy for Papa.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,93,He was the one who got fed up.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,94,"It's a little harder to change habits when you're older, and he had to do quite a few extra chores for forgetting his manners."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,95,"I'm glad to get out of the house, away from that Politeness Plan! he said as he drove the family along the highway on a trip to the supermarket."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,96,"Manners and courtesy are just as important away from home- especially on the road, said Mama as they stopped at a stop sign to let pedestrians and other cars pass."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,97,They help us drive safely.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,98,"Well, grumbled Papa as they all went into the busy supermarket, I think you can have too much of a good thing- you've got to have common sense along with manners!"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,99,"Why if you let everyone go ahead of you at the checkout, you'd be there forever!"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,100,"And sometimes you have to interrupt- Excuse me, mad am, he interrupted a shopper, but I believe you have a leaking bottle in your cart!"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,101,The shopper thanked him for his help.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,102,"You see? he said, driving home."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,103,There's more to life than remembering your manners.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,104,"Besides, manners are all right for cubs and mama bears. . ."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,105,. . .  But we papa bears have other things to think about-
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,106,At that moment the car in front stopped suddenly and Papa bumped into it.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,107,He was furious.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,108,"Why, that pinheaded fiddlebrain! he snarled."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,109,Name calling! reminded Sister.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,110,"The penalty for name calling was cleaning the whole cellar, so Papa gritted his teeth and remembered his manners."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,111,"And a good thing, too."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,112,"Because climbing out of the other car was the biggest, angriest bear he had ever seen!"
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,113,"But when the angry bear saw how polite Papa was, he remembered his manners too."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,114,He explained that he had stopped short because a mama duck and her ducklings had crossed in front of him.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,115,Then he and Papa Bear looked at their bumpers and saw that no harm had been done.
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,116,"As I was saying, said Papa as they continued on their way, it's very important for us to remember our manners at all times- and I want to thank you, Sister, for reminding me to remember mine."
M59,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS FORGET THEIR MANNERS,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,117,"You're very welcome, I'm sure, said Sister Bear politely."
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,1,This hat is not mine.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,2,I just stole it.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,3,I stole it from a big fish.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,4,He was asleep when I did it.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,5,And he probably won't wake up for along time.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,6,"And even if he does wake up, he probably won't notice that it's gone."
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,7,"And even if he does notice that it's gone, he probably won't know it was me who took it."
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,8,"And even if he does guess it was me, he won't know where I am going."
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,9,But I will tell you where I am going.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,10,I am going where the plants grow big and tall and close together.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,11,It is very hard to see in there.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,12,Nobody will ever find me.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,13,There is someone who saw me already.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,14,But he said he wouldn't tell anyone which way I went.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,15,So I am not worried about that.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,16,I know it's wrong to steal a hat.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,17,I know it does not belong to me.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,18,But I am going to keep it.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,19,It was too small for him anyway.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,20,It fits me just right.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,21,And look!
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,22,I made it!
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,23,There the plants are big and tall and close together.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,24,I knew I was going to make it.
M60,THIS IS NOT MY HAT,JON KLASSEN,25,Nobody will ever find me.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,1,There used to be an alligator under my bed.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,2,"When it was time to go to sleep, I had to be very careful because I knew he was there."
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,3,"But whenever I looked, he hid. . .  or something."
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,4,So I'd call Mom and Dad.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,5,But they never saw it.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,6,It was up to me.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,7,I just had to do something about that alligator.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,8,So I went to the kitchen to get some alligator bait.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,9,I filled a paper bag full of things alligators like to eat.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,10,"I put a peanut butter sandwich, some fruit, and the last piece of pie in the garage."
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,11,I put cookies down the hall.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,12,I left fresh vegetables on the stairs.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,13,I put a soda and some candy next to my bed.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,14,Then I watched and waited.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,15,"Sure enough, out he came to get something to eat."
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,16,Then I hid in the hall closet.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,17,I followed him down the stairs.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,18,I followed him down the hall.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,19,"When he crawled into the garage, I slammed the door and locked it."
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,20,Then I went to bed.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,21,There wasn't even any mess to clean up.
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,22,"Now that there is an alligator in the garage, I wonder if my dad will have any trouble getting in his car tomorrow morning."
M61,THERE'S AN ALLIGATOR UNDER MY BED,MERCER MAYER,23,I'll just leave him a note.
M62,THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR,ERIC CARLE,1,In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf.
M62,THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR,ERIC CARLE,2,One Sunday morning the warm sun came up and-pop!-out of the egg came a tiny and very hungry caterpillar.
M62,THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR,ERIC CARLE,3,He started to look for some food.
M62,THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR,ERIC CARLE,4,"On Monday, he ate through one apple."
M62,THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR,ERIC CARLE,5,But he was still hungry.
M62,THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR,ERIC CARLE,6,"On Tuesday he ate through two pears, but he was still hungry."

M62,THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR,ERIC CARLE,12,The next day was Sunday again.
M62,THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR,ERIC CARLE,13,"The caterpillar ate through one nice green leaf, and after that he felt much better."
M62,THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR,ERIC CARLE,14,Now he wasn't hungry anymore- and he wasn't a little caterpillar any more.
M62,THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR,ERIC CARLE,15,"He was a big, fat caterpillar."
M62,THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR,ERIC CARLE,16,"He built a small house, called a cocoon, around himself."
M62,THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR,ERIC CARLE,17,He stayed inside for more than two weeks.
M62,THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR,ERIC CARLE,18,"Then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon, pushed his way out and . . . he was a beautiful butterfly!"
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,1,"Not so long ago, before she could even speak words, Trixie went on an errand with her daddy.. . ."
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,2,"Trixie and her daddy went down the block, through the park, past the school, and into the Laundromat."
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,3,Trixie helped her daddy put the laundry into the machine.
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,4,She even got to put the money into the machine.
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,5,Then they left.
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,6,But a block or so later . . . Trixie realized something.
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,7,"Trixie turned to her daddy and said, Aggle flaggle klabble!"
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,8,"That's right, replied her daddy."
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,9,We're going home.
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,10,Aggle flaggle klabble! Said Trixie again.
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,11,Blaggle plaggle!
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,12,Wumby flappy?!
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,13,Snurp.
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,14,"Now, please don't get fussy, said her daddy."
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,15,"Well, she had no choice . . . ."
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,16,She went boneless.
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,17,She did everything she could to show how unhappy she was.
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,18,"By the time they got home, her daddy was unhappy, too."
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,19,"As soon as Trixie's mommy opened the door, she asked, Where's Knuffle Bunny?"
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,20,The whole family ran down the block.
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,21,And they ran through the park.
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,22,"They zoomed past the school, and into the Laundromat."
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,23,Trixie's daddy looked for Knuffle Bunny.
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,24,And looked . . .
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,25,And looked . . .
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,26,And looked . . .
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,27,But Knuffle Bunny was nowhere to be found.. . .
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,28,So Trixie's daddy decided to look harder.
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,29,Until . . . Knuffle Bunny!!!
M63,KNUFFLE BUNNY,MO WILLEMS,30,And those were the first words Trixie ever said.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,1,We're finally here! declares Lulu as she jumps out of the car and spreads her wings.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,2,I love the beach! says Lulu.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,3,"You've never even been to the beach before, replied her big brother."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,4,"But I already know that I love it, she says."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,5,And I can't wait to go swimming in the waves!
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,6,The sand feels warm under her feet as Lulu and Bingo lead the family to a good spot to spread their blanket.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,7,Lulu runs to the edge of the water.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,8,"The ocean goes on and on, and makes huge roaring sounds."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,9,She had no idea it was going to be so big and noisy.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,10,She takes a few steps backward.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,11,Bingo barks at the waves.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,12,"Are you going in? he brother yells, running past her and splashing into the water."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,13,"I don't think so, she says."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,14,Um . . .  I really came here to build sand castles.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,15,Lulu retreats to the beach blanket to find her trusty pail and shovel.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,16,"She builds a giant sand castle, and uses little sticks for people."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,17,"The King and the Queen are very happy here, she thinks."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,18,Bingo digs a moat to keep them extra safe.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,19,Lulu walks over and sits down next to her mama.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,20,"She looks out at the ocean, which is glittering with light."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,21,She thinks it looks pretty from far away.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,22,Do you want to go into the water? asks Mama.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,23,"No, Lulu says, I want to fly the kite now."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,24,"Soon the kite is darting back and forth in the wind, but Lulu holds on tight."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,25,"After the wind dies down, it feels really hot."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,26,Lulu glances at the ocean.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,27,"She thinks the water would be cool, but the waves still look much too big."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,28,This is a good time to remind her parents about ice cream.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,29,"Lulu lists all her top eleven favorite flavors: Chocolate Marshmallow, Cherry Vanilla, Pistachio, Butter Pecan, Peppermint Bon Bon, Peanut Butter Chip, Raspberry Swirl, Peach Pie, Almond Fudge, Royal Banana Surprise, and . . . vanilla."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,30,At the ice cream stand Lulu can't just choose one.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,31,"This is a day for a double scoop, her mama says."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,32,Sometimes mamas can be very right.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,33,"Come on, Bingo, says Lulu after she finishes her ice cream."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,34,Let's take a walk down the beach!
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,35,They find a long piece of driftwood.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,36,"Lulu writes Loopy L's in the sand, and draws pictures of Bingo."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,37,"He's the perfect subject, and stays really still."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,38,It is very hot.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,39,Lulu looks at the ocean.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,40,Other kids are splashing and jumping in the waves.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,41,She walks down to the edge of the water.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,42,"Should we get out feet wet, Bingo? She asks."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,43,She thinks it would be okay to go into the ocean just a little bit.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,44,Suddenly a wave crashes into her legs and nearly knocks her over.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,45,Just as she gets her balance the whirling water races back and tries to pull her in.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,46,Her feet get buried in the sand up to her ankles.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,47,"Are you okay, Bingo? Lulu asks."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,48,"She looks around to see if anyone notices that they were almost carried away, but everyone is playing just as they were before."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,49,"Let's be explorers! says Lulu, brushing the sand off her knees."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,50,We can collect things for our museum.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,51,They march off across the beach.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,52,"They hear seagulls that sound like they are laughing, discover little crabs that burrow into the sand, ad pick up slimy seaweed washed up on the shore."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,53,"There are also lots of shells on the beach, all different shapes and sizes."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,54,She chooses the most special one and puts them into her pail.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,55,"I know, Bingo!"
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,56,"I bet if we dig, we could find a pirate treasure! says Lulu."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,57,"She digs, and digs, and digs."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,58,Finding treasure is hard work.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,59,"When Lulu feels the water splash against her, she spins around."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,60,The tide has come in!
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,61,It is taking away her favorite pail!
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,62,She has to rescue it or it will be lost forever!
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,63,This is a job for Ladybug Girl!
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,64,"I'll save you! she says, snapping up the pail."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,65,"When she looks down, she realizes she is in the ocean."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,66,She is actually in the ocean!
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,67,"The water is past her knees, and she isn't afraid at all!"
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,68,Ladybug Girl isn't afraid of anything!
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,69,"For the rest of the long afternoon, Ladybug Girl and Bingo splash in the water and run on the beach daring the waves to catch them."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,70,"You can't get me, waves."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,71,I'm Ladybug Girl!
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,72,Ladybug Girl and Bingo play until the bright blue sky turns pink.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,73,They make footprints in the sand.
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,74,"At least 14 miles of them, Ladybug Girl thinks."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,75,"Every time the ocean erases them, they make more."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,76,"Then it is time to go, and Ladybug Girl trudges back across the still-warm sand."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,77,"Bingo follows slowly, dragging his ears."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,78,"Standing at the top of the dunes, Ladybug Girl waits for her brother."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,79,"So, did you like your first time at the beach? he asks."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,80,"Yes, she answers."
M64,LADYBUG GIRL AT THE BEACH,DAVID SOMAN AND JACKY DAVIS,81,"I told you, Ladybug Girl loves the beach!"
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,1,Amos McGee was AN Early RISER.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,2,"Every morning when the alarm clock clanged, he swung his legs out of bed and swapped his pajamas for a fresh-pressed uniform."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,3,"He would wind his watch and set a pot of water to boil-saying to the sugar bowl, A spoonful for my oatmeal, please, and two for my teacup."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,4,"Belly full and ready for the workday, he'd amble out the door."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,5,Every day Amos waited for the number five bus.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,6,"Next stop, City Zoo, the bus driver would call."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,7,"6 a.m. right on time, he'd reply."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,8,"Amos had a lot to do at the zoo, but he always made time to visit his good friends."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,9,"He would play chess with the elephant (who thought and thought before making a move), run races with the tortoise (who never ever lost), sit quietly with the penguin (who was very shy), lend a handkerchief to the rhinoceros (who always had a runny nose), and, at sunset, read stories to the owl (who was afraid of the dark)."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,10,"One Day Amos Awoke with the sniffles, and the sneezes, and the chills."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,11,"He swung his achy legs out of bed, curled them back again and said, Ugh."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,12,I don't think I'll be going to work today.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,13,Meanwhile AT THE zoo . . .
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,14,The animals waited for their friend.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,15,The elephant arranged his pawns and polished his castles.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,16,The tortoise stretched his legs and limbered up.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,17,"The penguin sat patiently, all by himself."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,18,The rhinoceros worried that his allergies were worsening.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,19,"The owl perched atop a tall, stack of storybooks, scratching his head with concern."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,20,Where is Amos? the animals wondered.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,21,Later that day. . .
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,22,Hooray!
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,23,My good friends are here!
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,24,The elephant prepared a game of chess.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,25,Amos thought and thought before making a move.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,26,"I'm too tired to run races today, said Amos to the tortoise."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,27,Let's play hide-and-seek instead.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,28,The tortoise hid inside his shell.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,29,Amos hid beneath the covers.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,30,"Amos yawned, I could use a nap."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,31,"The penguin sat quietly, keeping Amos's feet warm."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,32,"I'm beginning to feel much better, thank you, said Amos to his friends."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,33,He swung his legs out of bed.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,34,Perhaps we'll share a pot of tea.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,35,Amos wound his alarm clock.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,36,"It's getting late, he said."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,37,"After all, we have a morning bus to catch."
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,38,So Amos said goodnight to the elephant.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,39,And goodnight to the tortoise.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,40,And goodnight to the penguin.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,41,And goodnight to the rhinoceros.
M65,A SICK DAY FOR AMOS MCGEE,PHILIP C. STEAD,42,"And goodnight to the owl, who-knowing that Amos was afraid of the dark-read a story aloud before turning out the light."
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,1,It was late.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,2,Froggy was too pooped to pop.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,3,He'd been playing hard at Max's all day long.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,4,FRROOGGYY! called his mother.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,5,Whaaat?

M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,9,Why don't you take a nice bath? she said.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,10,We'll make it a bubble bath.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,11,"Okay, said Froggy."
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,12,But first I have to find my boat!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,13,-flop flop flop.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,14,He looked in the fridge.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,15,Nope!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,16,He looked beneath the sink.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,17,Not here!

M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,19,I found it!

M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,21,Now it's time to Put your pajamas on! said his mother.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,22,And she wrapped him all cozy warm in a towel.

M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,24,But first I have to find them!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,25,-flop flop flop.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,26,He looked on his floor.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,27,Nope!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,28,He looked in his toy chest.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,29,Not here!

M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,31,I found them!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,32,And he put them on-zwoop.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,33,FRROOGGYY! called his mother.

M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,44,I found it!

M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,54,Bonk!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,55,He gave it a hug and climbed into bed.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,56,"Now it's time to sleep! said his mother, and gave him a good-night kiss."
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,57,"Okay, said Froggy."
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,58,But first I need a snack!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,59,Then I'll go to sleep.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,60,And he hopped out of bed-flop flop flop.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,61,Munch scrunch munch.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,62,He ate a bowl of flies. . .  then crawled back into bed.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,63,"Now go to sleep, Froggy! said his mother."
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,64,She was getting a little tired herself.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,65,"Okay, said froggy."
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,66,But I'm thirsty!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,67,And you have to close the closet!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,68,And open my door just a crack!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,69,And turn the night-light down just how I like it!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,70,Then I'll go to sleep!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,71,"Oh fiddlesticks! said his mother, and got him a glass of water."
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,72,"Oops! cried froggy, looking more red in the face than green."
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,73,It spilled!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,74,"Oh, Froggy, said his mother."
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,75,She wiped it up. . .
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,76,Then got him another glass of water-glug glug glug.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,77,Closed the closet-slam!
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,78,Opened his door just a crack-creeeak.

M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,84,"Of course, dear."
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,85,She yawned.

M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,87,And she read. . .
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,88,"And she read. . . till the book dropped-thump!-and she fell asleep, snoring like a horse."
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,89,"Good night, Mom, said Froggy."
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,90,Then he closed his eyes and went to sleep-zzzzzzz.
M66,FROGGY GOES TO BED,JONATHAN LONDON,91,"Good night, Froggy! said Mr. Owl, sitting on a branch."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,1,I was putting flowers on the mane of my pet unicorn.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,2,"Pinkalicious, why are you dropping flowers on the rug? asked Mommy."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,3,I'm not dropping flowers.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,4,"I am getting Goldie ready for the Unicorn Ball, I said, prancing around the room."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,5,What unicorn?
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,6,"I don't see any unicorn, said Peter."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,7,"She's right here and she's not ANY unicorn, she is my unicorn."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,8,"Her name is Goldilicious, Goldie for short."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,9,"Oh, Goldie-you shouldn't have done that on the floor!"
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,10,You know better.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,11,Just neigh when you need to go to the potty.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,12,"I'm sorry, Peter, but you are stepping right in it, I said."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,13,Mommy!
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,14,What is Pinkalicious talking about? whined Peter.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,15,"Pinkalicious, it's okay to have an imaginary friend, but maybe it's time to put Goldie back in her stall or take her outside the house, where she can run free."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,16,"Okay, Mommy."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,17,"Come on, Goldie, we know where we aren't wanted, I said, galloping out the door."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,18,I took Goldie out to the perfect her pinkerrific pirouette.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,19,Goldie is very graceful and has a wonderful sense of balance.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,20,"We were thinking of joining the Majestic Magenta Ballet, but there are only a few extremely special and unique people who can see Goldie, namely, ME!"
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,21,"Goldie is also a pinkatastic roller skater, kite flyer, and high jumper."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,22,She is very fast.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,23,I can never keep up with her.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,24,"Godieeeeeee, wait for me!"
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,25,"Goldie, where are you?"
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,26,"She loves to play hide-and-seek, but she is too quick for me."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,27,"As soon as I spot her, she is gone."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,28,"Oh, you turned into a fairy princess and you are having a tea party."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,29,"Goldilicious, this is the most delicious cake I have ever had!"
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,30,And where did you ever find this sweet flower nectar? I asked.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,31,"Pinkalicious, may I join your tea party? Peter asked."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,32,"Please, Peter, you are about to sit on Goldie!"
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,33,"Be careful, I scolded."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,34,"Here is a little cinnamon stick for your tea, said Peter."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,35,That is a WORM! Now you have insulted our host.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,36,You better watch out. . .  because Goldie will always protect me! I shouted.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,37,Not if I kidnap her and hold her prisoner in the castle tower!
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,38,"Beware, fair sister, or your golden pet will become broth for my magical cauldron, Peter yelled from the tree house."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,39,"Don't worry, Goldie, I will rescue you from the Wandering Wizard, I said."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,40,"Pinkalicious, you must gaze into this crystal ball as I cast a spell, Peter chanted as he threw a ball over the side of the tree house."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,41,"Abracadabra, abracadin, wizard out, pirate in!"
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,42,"Ahoy, matey, Goldilicious will never become your treasure!"
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,43,I will make you walk the plank!
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,44,I suddenly realized that Goldilicious was nowhere to be seen.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,45,"Hey, Peter, where did she go?"
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,46,"Look, she turned into a mermaid! Peter pointed to Goldilicious."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,47,"Oh, that is just her dress-up outfit."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,48,She's not a real mermaid.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,49,"She is just pretending, I told Peter."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,50,"Wow, not only can she float on water, she can float in the air."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,51,Goldilicious is flying! said Peter.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,52,Come back! I screamed.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,53,Will she come back tomorrow?
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,54,"I'm going to find my lasso so I can catch her in the morning when I wake up, said Peter."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,55,"That's if you can find her, I yelled as Peter ran off."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,56,"Goldie, where did you go?"
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,57,Have you become one with the universe?
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,58,"Pinkalicious, it's time to go to bed."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,59,"Come in now, bellowed voices from the door."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,60,"Perhaps Goldie is hiding from the mean sorcerers who have come to take me to the dungeon, I said loudly."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,61,"Pinkalicious, we heard that."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,62,"Oh, pardon me, I meant Sir Daddy and Lady Mommy, rulers supreme and gracious guardians of the Princess of Pink."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,63,NOW!
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,64,"Okay, okay, I'm coming to bed, but I don't know where Goldie is, and she will miss me if I don't pet her good night."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,65,"Oh, she was here waiting for me all along! I said, climbing into bed and closing my eyes."
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,66,Sweet dreams.
M67,GOLDILICIOUS,VICTORIA KANN,67,"See you tomorrow, Mommy and Daddy said, kissing us both good night."

M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,23,That made the act even better.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,24,The tightrope walker had a sprained ankle.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,25,Clifford tried to walk the tightrope.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,26,He was pretty good.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,27,It wasn't his fault that he couldn't get off the ground.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,28,Before the next act we walked out on the midway.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,29,Clifford loves cotton candy.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,30,He sniffed it.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,31,He sniffed a little too hard.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,32,Licking the cotton candy off his nose made him thirsty.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,33,He took a drink.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,34,The circus man tried to stop him.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,35,It was too late.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,36,Clifford had spoiled the high diver's act.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,37,But he didn't spoil the high diver.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,38,"Whew, that was close."
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,39,The second half of the circus began with the elephants on parade.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,40,The biggest elephant had a cold in its nose and couldn't lead the parade.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,41,So Clifford slipped into an elephant suit and gave them a hand.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,42,I mean a tail.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,43,The next act was the human cannon ball.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,44,She didn't have any gunpowder for her cannon.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,45,So Clifford helped her out.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,46,He helped her right out of the tent.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,47,Then came the grand finale.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,48,I was going up in a balloon with the circus man.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,49,Everyone came out to watch.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,50,"Oh dear, the rope broke."
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,51,I didn't worry.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,52,I knew Clifford would save us.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,53,He rushed to the rescue.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,54,But he missed the rope.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,55,We were blowing away.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,56,Things looked bad.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,57,Clifford didn't give up.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,58,He grabbed an extra tent pole.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,59,He used some telephone wire and took aim.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,60,Bull's-eye!
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,61,The balloon was falling like a rock.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,62,We were scared silly.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,63,But Clifford got there in time.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,64,Good old Clifford.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,65,Everybody said it was the most exciting end a circus ever had.
M76,CLIFFORD AT THE CIRCUS,NORMAN BRIDWELL,66,"Clifford saved the show, and me."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,1,The sun did not shine.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,2,It was too wet to play.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,3,"So we sat in the house all that cold, cold, wet day."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,4,I sat there with sally.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,5,"We sat there, we two."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,6,"And i said, how i wish we had something to do!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,7,Too wet to go out and too cold to play ball.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,8,So we sat in the house.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,9,We did nothing at all.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,10,So all we could do was to sit!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,11,Sit!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,12,Sit!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,13,Sit!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,14,And we did not like it.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,15,Not one little bit.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,16,And then something went bump!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,17,How that bump made us jump!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,18,We looked!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,19,Then we saw him step in on the mat!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,20,We looked!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,21,And we saw him!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,22,The cat in the hat!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,23,"And he said to us, why do you sit there like that?"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,24,i know it is wet and the sun is not sunny.

M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,31,Then sally and i did not know what to say.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,32,Our mother was out of the house for the day.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,33,"But our fish said, no! No!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,34,Make that cat go away!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,35,Tell that cat in the hat you do not want to play.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,36,He should not be here.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,37,He should not be about.

M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,43,Put me down! said the fish.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,44,This is no fun at all!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,45,Put me down! said the fish.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,46,I do not wish to fall!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,47,Have no fear! said the cat.

M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,51,And a cup on my hat!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,52,But that is not ALL I can do! Said the cat . . .

M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,62,But that is not all!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,63,"Oh, no."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,64,That is not all . . .
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,65,Look at me!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,66,Look at me!

M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,76,But that is not all.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,77,"Oh, no."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,78,That is not all. . . .
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,79,That is what the cat said . . .
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,80,Then he fell on his head!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,81,He came down with a bump from up there on the ball.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,82,"And Sally and I, We saw all the things fall!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,83,"And our fish came down, too."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,84,He fell into a pot!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,85,"He said, Do I like this?"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,86,"Oh, no!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,87,I do not.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,88,"This is not a good game, Said our fish as he lit."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,89,"No, I do not like it, Not one little bit!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,90,Now look what you did! Said the fish to the cat.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,91,Now look at this house!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,92,Look at this!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,93,Look at that!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,94,"You sank our toy ship, Sank it deep in the cake."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,95,You shook up our house and you bent our new rake.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,96,You should not be here when our mother is not.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,97,You get out of this house! Said the fish in the pot.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,98,But I like to be here.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,99,"Oh, I like it a lot! Said the Cat in the Hat To the fish in the pot."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,100,I will not go away.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,101,I do not wish to go!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,102,"And so, said the Cat in the Hat, So so so. . .  I will show you another good game that I know!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,103,And then he ran out.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,104,"And, then, fast as a fox, The Cat in the Hat Came back in with a box."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,105,A big red wood box.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,106,It was shut with a hook.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,107,"Now look at this trick, Said the cat."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,108,Take a look!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,109,Then he got up on top With a tip of his hat.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,110,"I call this game FUN-IN-A-box, Said the cat."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,111,In this box are two things I will show to you now.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,112,"You will like these two things, Said the cat with a bow."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,113,I will pick up the hook.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,114,You will see something new.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,115,Two things.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,116,And I call them Thing One and thing Two.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,117,These things will not bite you.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,118,They want to have fun.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,119,"Then, out of the box Came Thing Two and Thing One!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,120,And they ran to us fast.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,121,"They said, How do you do?"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,122,Would you like to shake hands With Thing One and Thing Two?
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,123,And Sally and I Did not know what to do.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,124,So we had to shake hands With Thing One and Thing Two.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,125,We shook their two hands.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,126,"But our fish said, No! No!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,127,Those Things should not be in this house!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,128,Make them go!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,129,They should not be here when your mother is not!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,130,Put them out!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,131,Put them out! said the fish in the pot.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,132,"Have no fear, little fish, Said the Cat in the Hat."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,133,These Things are good Things.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,134,And he gave them a pat.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,135,They are tame.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,136,"Oh, so tame!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,137,They have come here to play.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,138,"They will give you some fun on this wet, wet, wet day."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,139,"Now, here is a game that they like, Said the cat."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,140,"They like to fly kites, Said the Cat in the Hat."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,141,No!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,142,Not in the house! said the fish in the pot.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,143,They should not fly kites in a house!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,144,They should not.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,145,"Oh, the things they will bump!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,146,"Oh, the things they will hit!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,147,"Oh, I do not like it!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,148,Not one little bit!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,149,Then Sally and I Saw them run down the hall.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,150,We saw those two Things Bump their kites on the wall!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,151,Bump!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,152,Thump!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,153,Thump!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,154,Bump!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,155,Down the wall in the hall.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,156,Thing two and thing one!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,157,They ran up!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,158,They ran down!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,159,On the string of one kite we saw mother's new gown!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,160,"Her gown with the dots that are pink, white and red."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,161,Then we saw one kite bump on the head of her bed.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,162,"Then those Things ran about with big bumps, jumps and kicks and with hops and big thumps and all kinds of bad tricks."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,163,"And I said, I do not like the way that they play!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,164,"If Mother could see this, Oh, what would she say!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,165,"Then our fish said, Look! Look!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,166,And our fish shook with fear.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,167,Your mother is on her way home!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,168,Do you hear?
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,169,"Oh, what will she do to us?"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,170,What will she say?
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,171,"Oh, she will not like it to find us this way!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,172,"So, Do something! Fast! said the fish."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,173,Do you hear!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,174,I saw her.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,175,Your mother!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,176,Your mother is near!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,177,"So, as fast as you can, think of something to do!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,178,You will have to get rid of Thing One and Thing Two!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,179,"So, as fast as I could, I went after my net."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,180,"And I said, With my net I can get them I bet."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,181,"I bet, with my net, I can get those Things yet!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,182,Then I let down my net.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,183,It came down with a PLOP!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,184,And I had them!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,185,At last!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,186,Those two things had to stop.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,187,"Then I said to the cat, Now you do as I say."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,188,You pack up those things and you take them away!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,189,Oh dear! said that cat.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,190,You did not like our game. . .
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,191,Oh dear.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,192,What a shame!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,193,What a shame!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,194,What a shame!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,195,Then he shut up the Things In the box with the hook.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,196,And the cat went away with a sad kind of look.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,197,"That is good, said the fish."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,198,He has gone away.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,199,Yes.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,200,But your mother will come.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,201,She will find this big mess!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,202,"And this mess is so big and so deep and so tall, We can not Pick it up."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,203,There is no way at all!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,204,And THEN!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,205,Who was back in the house?
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,206,"Why, the cat!"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,207,"Have no fear of this mess, said the Cat in the Hat."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,208,I always pick up all my playthings and so. . .
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,209,I will show you another Good trick that I know!
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,210,Then we saw him pick up all the things that were down.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,211,"He picked up the cake, And the rake, and the gown, And the milk, and the strings, And the books, and the dish, And the fan, and the cup, and the ship, and the fish."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,212,And he put them away.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,213,"Then he said, That is that."
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,214,And then he was gone with a tip of his hat.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,215,"Then our mother came in and she said to us two, Did you have any fun?"
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,216,Tell me.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,217,What did you do?
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,218,And Sally and I did not know what to say.
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,219,Should we tell her the things that went on there that day?
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,220,Should we tell her about it?
M77,THE CAT IN THE HAT,DR. SEUSS,221,"Now, what should we do?"

M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,7,You can call me Al.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,8,"I don't know how this whole Big Bad wolf thing got started, but it's all wrong."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,9,Maybe it's because of our diet.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,10,"Hey, it's not my fault wolves eat cute little animals like bunnies and sheep and pigs."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,11,That's just the way we are.

M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,15,"Way back in Once Upon a Time time, I was making a birthday cake for my dear old granny."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,16,I had a terrible sneezing cold.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,17,I ran out of sugar.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,18,So I walked down the street to ask my neighbor for a cup of sugar.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,19,Now this neighbor was a pig.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,20,And he wasn't too bright either.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,21,He had built his whole house out of straw.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,22,Can you believe it?
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,23,I mean who in his right mind would build a house of straw?
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,24,"So of course the minute I knocked on the door, it fell right in."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,25,I didn't want to just walk into someone else's house.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,26,"So I called, Little Pig, Little Pig, are you in?"
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,27,No answer.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,28,I was just about to go home without the cup of sugar for my dear old granny's birthday cake.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,29,That's when my nose started to itch.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,30,I felt a sneeze coming on.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,31,Well I huffed.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,32,And I snuffed.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,33,And I sneezed a great sneeze.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,34,And you know what?
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,35,That whore darn straw house fell down.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,36,And right in the middle of the pile of straw was the First Little Pig-dead as a doornail.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,37,He had been home the whole time.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,38,It seemed like a shame to leave a perfectly good ham dinner lying there in the straw.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,39,So I ate it up.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,40,Think of it as a big cheeseburger just lying there.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,41,I was feeling a little better.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,42,But I still didn't have my cup of sugar.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,43,So I went to the next neighbor's house.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,44,This neighbor was the First Little pig's brother.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,45,"He was a little smarter, but not much."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,46,He had built his house of sticks.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,47,I rang the bell on the stick house.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,48,Nobody answered.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,49,"I called, Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig, are you in?"
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,50,"He yelled back, Go away wolf."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,51,You can't come in.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,52,I'm shaving the hairs on my chinny chin chin.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,53,I had just grabbed the doorknob when I felt another sneeze coming on.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,54,I huffed.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,55,And I snuffed.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,56,"And I tried to cover my mouth, but I sneezed a great sneeze."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,57,"And you're not going to believe it, but this guy's house fell down just like his brother's."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,58,"When the dust cleared, there was the Second Little Pig-dead as a doornail."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,59,Wolf's honor.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,60,Now you know food will spoil if you just leave it out in the open.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,61,So I did the only thing there was to do.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,62,I had dinner again.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,63,Think of it as a second helping.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,64,I was getting awfully full.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,65,But my cold was feeling a little better.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,66,And I still didn't have that cup of sugar for my dear old granny's birthday cake.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,67,So I went to the next house.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,68,This guy was the First and Second Little Pigs' brother.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,69,He must have been the brains of the family.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,70,He had built his house of bricks.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,71,I knocked on the brick house.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,72,No answer.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,73,"I called, Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig, are you in?"
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,74,And do you know what that rude little porker answered?
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,75,"Get out of here, Wolf."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,76,Don't bother me again.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,77,Talk about impolite!
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,78,He probably had a whole sackful of sugar.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,79,And he wouldn't give me even one little cup for my dear sweet old granny's birthday cake.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,80,What a pig!
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,81,"I was just about to go home and maybe make a nice birthday card instead of a cake, when I felt my cold coming on."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,82,I huffed.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,83,And I snuffed.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,84,And I sneezed once again.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,85,"Then the Third little pig yelled, And your old granny can sit on a pin!"
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,86,Now I'm usually a pretty calm fellow.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,87,"But when somebody talks about my granny like that, I go a little crazy."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,88,"When the cops drove up, of course I was trying to break down this Pig's door."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,89,And the whole time I was huffing and puffing and sneezing and making a real scene.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,90,"The rest, as they say, is history."
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,91,The news reporters found out about the two pigs I had for dinner.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,92,They figured a sick guy going to borrow a cup of sugar didn't sound very exciting.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,93,So they jazzed up the story with all of that Huff and puff and blow your house down.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,94,And they made me the Big Bad Wolf.
M80,THE TRUE STORY OF THE 3 LITTLE PIGS!,JON SCIESZKA,95,That's it.

M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,4,WE NEED to talk.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,5,You make me work harder than any of your other crayons.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,6,"All year long I wear myself out coloring FIRE ENGINES, Apples, strawberries and EVERYTHING ELSE that's RED."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,7,I even work on Holidays!

M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,14,"I love that I'm your favorite crayon for grapes, dragons, and wizard's hats, but it makes me crazy that so much of my gorgeous color goes outside the lines."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,15,If you DON'T START COLORING INSIDE the lines soon . . .
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,16,I'm going to COMPLETELY LOSE IT
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,17,"Your very neat friend,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,18,Purple Crayon
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,19,"Dear Duncan,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,20,I'm tired of being called light brown or Dark tan because I am neither.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,21,I am BEIGE and I am proud.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,22,I'm also tired of being second place to Mr. Brown Crayon.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,23,"It's not fair that Brown gets all the bears, ponies and puppies while the only things I get are turkey dinners (if I'm lucky) and wheat, and let's be honest–when was the last time you saw a kid excited about coloring wheat?"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,24,"Your BEIGE friend,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,25,Beige Crayon
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,26,"Duncan, GRAY Crayon here."

M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,28,I know you love Elephants And I know that elephants are gray. . .  but that's a LOT of space to color in all by myself.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,29,"And don't even get me started on your rhinos, hippos and HUMPBACK WHALES. . .  you know how tired I am after handling one of those big things?"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,30,Such BIG animals. . .
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,31,"Baby penguins are gray, you know."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,32,So are very tiny rocks.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,33,Pebbles.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,34,How about one of those once in a while to give me a break?
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,35,"Your very tired friend,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,36,Gray Crayon
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,37,"Dear Duncan,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,38,"You color with me, but why?"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,39,Most of the time I'm the same color as the page you are using me on–WHITE.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,40,"If I didn't have a black outline, you wouldn't even know I was THERE!"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,41,I'm not even in the rainbow.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,42,I'm only used to color SNOW or to fill in empty space between other things.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,43,And it leaves me feeling. . .  well. . .  empty.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,44,We need to talk.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,45,"Your empty friend,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,46,White Crayon
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,47,"Hi, Duncan,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,48,I HATE being used to draw the outline of things. . .
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,49,". . .  things that are colored in by other colors, all of which think they're brighter than me!"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,50,It's NOT FAIR when you use me to draw a nice beach ball and then fill in the colors of the ball with ALL THE OTHER CRAYONS.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,51,How about a BLACK Beach ball sometime?
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,52,Is that too much to ask?
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,53,"Your Friend,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,54,Black Crayon
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,55,"Dear Duncan,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,56,"As Green Crayon, I am writing for two reasons."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,57,"One is to say that I like my workloads of crocodiles, trees, dinosaurs, and frogs."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,58,I have no problem and wish to congratulate you on a very successful coloring things Green career so far.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,59,"The second reason I write is for my friends, Yellow Crayon and Orange Crayon, who are no longer speaking to each other."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,60,Both crayons feel THEY should be the color of the sun.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,61,Please settle this soon because they're driving the rest of us CRAZY!
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,62,"Your happy friend,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,63,Green Crayon
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,64,"Dear Duncan,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,65,Yellow Crayon here.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,66,I need you to tell orange crayon that I am the color of the sun.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,67,I would tell him but we are no longer speaking.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,68,And I can PROVE I'm the color of the sun too!
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,69,"Last Tuesday, you used me to color in the sun on your HAPPY FARM coloring book."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,70,"In case you've forgotten, it's on page 7."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,71,You CAN'T MISS me.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,72,I'm shining down brilliantly on a field of YELLOW corn!
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,73,"Your pal (and the true color of the sun),"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,74,Orange Crayon
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,75,"Dear Duncan,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,76,"I see Yellow Crayon already talked to you, the BIG WHINER."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,77,"Anyway, could you please tell Mr. Tattletale that he IS NOT the color of the sun?"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,78,"I would, but we are no longer speaking."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,79,"We both know that I am clearly the color of the SUN because, on Thursday, you used me to color the sun on BOTH the Monkey Island and the Meet the Zookeeper pages in your DAY AT THE ZOO coloring book."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,80,Orange you glad I'm here?
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,81,Ha!
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,82,"Your pal (and the real color of the sun),"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,83,Orange Crayon
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,84,"Dear DUNCAN,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,85,It has been great being your FAVORITE color this PAST Year.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,86,And the Year before THAT!
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,87,"I have really enjoyed all those OCEANS, LAKES, Rivers, raindrops, rain CLOUDS and CLEAR skies."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,88,"But the BAD NEWS is that I am so short and stubby, I can't even see over the railing in the CRAYON BOX anymore!"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,89,I need a BREAK!
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,90,Your very stubby friend.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,91,Blue Crayon
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,92,"Duncan, Okay, LISTEN HERE, KID!"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,93,You have not used me ONCE in the past year.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,94,"It's because you think I am a GIRLS' color, isn't it?"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,95,"Speaking of which, please tell your little sister I said thank you for using me to color in her little princess coloring book."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,96,I think she did a fabulous job of staying inside the lines!
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,97,"Now, back to us."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,98,Could you PLEASE use me sometime to color the occasional PINK dinosaur or MONSTER or cowboy?
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,99,Goodness knows they could use a splash of color.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,100,"Your unused friend,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,101,Pink Crayon
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,102,"Hey Duncan,"
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,103,"It's me, PEACH CRAYON."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,104,WHY did you peel off my paper wrapping??
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,105,Now I'm NAKED and too embarrassed to leave the crayon box.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,106,I don't even have any underwear!
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,107,How would You like to go to school naked?
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,108,I need some clothes.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,109,HELP!

M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,112,"Well, poor Duncan just wanted to color . . ."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,113,And of course he wanted his crayons to be happy.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,114,And that gave him an idea.
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,115,"Then Duncan showed his teacher his new picture, she gave him an A for coloring. . ."
M82,THE DAY THE CRAYONS QUIT,DREW DAYWALT,116,And an A+ for creativity!
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,1,"Arthur's teacher, Mr. Rathburn, explained the homework."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,2,What should the story be about? Arthur asked.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,3,"Anything, Mr. Rathburn said."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,4,Write about something that is important to you.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,5,Arthur started his story the minute he got home.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,6,He knew exactly what he wanted to write about.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,7,How I got my Puppy Pal.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,8,"I always wanted a dog, but first I had to prove I was responsible."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,9,So I started Arthur's Pet Business.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,10,My mom made me keep all the animals in the basement.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,11,"It was a lot of work, but it was fun until I thought I lost perky."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,12,"But then I found her, and she had three puppies!"
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,13,And I got to keep one of them.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,14,That's how I got my dog Pal
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,15,The End
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,16,Arthur read his story to DW.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,17,"That's a boring story, D.W. said."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,18,Does it have to be real life?
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,19,Because your life is so dull.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,20,"I don't want to write a boring story, Said Arthur."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,21,"If it were me, D.W. suggested, I'd make the story about getting an elephant."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,22,"The next day, Arthur read his new story to Buster."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,23,Did you like the part about the elephant puppies? he asked.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,24,"It's okay, I guess, said Buster."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,25,I'm writing a cool story about outer space.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,26,Maybe my story should take place on the moon thought Arthur.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,27,"On Wednesday, Arthur read his newest story to the Brain."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,28,"Scientifically speaking, elephants would weigh less on the moon, but wouldn't float that high, Said the brain"
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,29,So you don't like it? asked Arthur.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,30,"A good story should be well researched, Said the Brain."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,31,Like mine: ‘If I Had a Pet Stegosaurus in the Jurassic Period.'
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,32,Arthur hurried to the library.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,33,What are all those books for? asked Francine.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,34,"Research, said Arthur."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,35,I'm writing about my pet five-toed mammal of the genus Loxodonta.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,36,Your what? asked Francine.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,37,My elephant! Arthur explained.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,38,"Oh, said Francine."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,39,I'm putting jokes in my story.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,40,"All through dinner, Arthur worried about his story."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,41,"Please pass the corn, asked Father."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,42,Corn!
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,43,That's it! said Arthur.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,44,Purple corn and blue elephants!
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,45,On Planet Shmellafint!
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,46,Now that's funny.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,47,"Arthur is acting weirder than usual, said D.W."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,48,"On Thursday, everyone at the Sugar Bowl was talking about their stories."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,49,"Last year, a kid wrote a country-western song for her story, Said Prunella."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,50,And she got an A+
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,51,How do you know? asked Arthur.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,52,"That kid was me, explained Prunella."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,53,Mr. Ratburn said I should send it to a record company.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,54,It was that good.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,55,Wow! said Arthur.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,56,"That night, Arthur's imagination went wild."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,57,He decided to turn his story into a song.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,58,He even made up a dance to go with it.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,59,"Later, he tried it out on his family."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,60,. . . Now this little boy can go home and enjoy his own personal striped elephant.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,61,And you will see How happy he will be here on Planet. . .  Shmellafint!
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,62,"Well, said Arthur. What do you think?"
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,63,Mother and Father smiled.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,64,"It's nice, said Grandma Thora."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,65,But a little confusing.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,66,"Too bad you can't dance, said D.W."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,67,What am I going to do? said Arthur.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,68,My story is due tomorrow.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,69,That night Arthur didn't sleep very well.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,70,"The next day, Arthur worried until Mr. Ratburn finally called on him."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,71,"When Arthur's song and dance was over, the classroom was so quiet it was almost spooky."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,72,Blinky raised his hand.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,73,Did that really happen?
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,74,"Sort of, said Arthur."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,75,It started as the story of how I got my dog.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,76,"I'd like to hear that story, said Mr. Ratburn."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,77,"The title was ‘How I Got My Puppy Pal, said Arthur."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,78,Arthur told how proud he was of his pet business and how scared he was when Perky disappeared.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,79,And he told how happy he was to find her under his bed and how surprised he was to see her three puppies.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,80,"And the best part is, said Arthur, I got to keep one!"
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,81,"Buster said, I like that story better than your other one."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,82,Great story! said Blinky.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,83,I think Arthur's story was the best! said Francine.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,84,"Good work, said Mr. Ratburn."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,85,"Of course, I expect you to write it all down by Monday."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,86,Then Mr. Ratburn gave Arthur a gold sticker.
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,87,"Oh, and one more thing, he said."
M83,ARTHUR WRITES A STORY,MARC BROWN,88,Leave out the dancing!
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,1,"Max, said Max's sister, Ruby."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,2,It's time for Grandma's birthday party!
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,3,Max wound up his Jellyball Shooter Spider.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,4,"The spider shot red, blue, and yellow jellyballs."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,5,"I sent out 10 party invitations, Max, said Ruby."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,6,All the guests wrote back and checked the Yes box.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,7,Will you help me put out the name cards?
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,8,1 is Rapunzel.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,9,2 is Curly Shirley Shirley.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,10,3 is the Tooth Fairy.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,11,4 and 5 are Mr. and Mrs. Quack.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,12,"6 is Pinocchio, and 7 is walky-talky Teddy Bear."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,13,"Then there's me, you, and Grandma."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,14,But Max did not like any of Ruby's guests.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,15,"He wanted to put his Jellyball Shooter Spider, his Ear-splitter Space Cadet, and his Can't-Sit-Up Slug in the chairs next to Grandma's place."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,16,"No, Max, said Ruby."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,17,Grandma hates spiders and slugs and space cadets.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,18,Grandma wants to sit between Rapunzel and the Tooth Fairy.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,19,Max pushed the red button on the Space Cadet's Ear-Splitter Space Siren.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,20,Ruby put all the guests in their chairs.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,21,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 stuffed guests, Max, said Ruby."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,22,Ruby went to get snappers and candy kisses.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,23,Max took the crown and wig off Rapunzel and put them on his spider.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,24,Then Max put Rapunzel in his own seat and the Jellyball shooter in Rapunzel's seat.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,25,Ruby filled the favor baskets with Kisses.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,26,She did not notice the spider.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,27,"That's funny, Mam, said Ruby."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,28,All the guests are in their seats.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,29,"But there are only two chairs left for Grandma, you, and me."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,30,"I must have counted wrong, Max! said Ruby."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,31,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!"
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,32,Ruby did not know where the extra guest had come from.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,33,"I will have to set another place, Max, said Ruby."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,34,Max fetched his Can't-Sit-Up Slug.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,35,He put the Tooth Fairy's magic wand and wings on the Slug.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,36,Then he sat the Slug in the Tooth Fairy's seat and moved the Tooth Fairy to another seat.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,37,Ruby came back with a new place setting.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,38,She did not notice the slug.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,39,"Something's wrong, Max, said Ruby."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,40,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 guests!"
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,41,Somewhere there are 2 extra guests.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,42,It must be a bad counting day.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,43,We need another chair!
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,44,Max took his Ear-Splitter Space Cadet and dressed him in Mrs. Quack's sun hat and veil.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,45,Then he put the Space Cadet into Grandma's seat.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,46,"How many people at this table, Max? said Ruby."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,47,"9, 3, 2, said Max."
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,48,There are 10 guests now! said Ruby.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,49,Suddenly Grandma knocked at the door.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,50,Max introduced Grandma to the Jellyball Shooter Spider and the Ear-Splitter Space Cadet.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,51,The Can't-Sit-Up Slug slumped in its chair.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,52,I have just discovered 3 uninvited guests! said Ruby.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,53,How exciting! said Grandma.
M84,BUNNY PARTY,ROSEMARY WELLS,54,Grandma made sure that the uninvited guests all had their snappers and their candy Kisses and their favorite flavors of ice cream

M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,1,It was a happy time in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road in Bear Country- a happy birthday time.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,2,"It was Brother Bear's birthday, and he was getting some very fine presents."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,3,"Brother wasn't exactly having a party, but Cousin Fred, Lizzy Bruin, and Babs Bruno were there."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,4,"And, Gramps and Gran, of course."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,5,Wow! said Brother when he opened his Present from Gramps.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,6,It was an aluminum bat.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,7,"Thanks, Gramps."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,8,I'll hit twenty home runs with this!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,9,Gran's Present was a great-looking warm-up jacket.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,10,Brother tried it on and looked in the mirror.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,11,"Thank You, Gran."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,12,"It's really neat, he said."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,13,"His other presents were a fielder's glove from Cousin Fred, a sports video from Lizzy Bruin, and a mystery book from Babs Bruno."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,14,"Sister's very thoughtful gift was a package of balsa wood, the special wood Brother used for making model airplanes."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,15,Thank you!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,16,Thank you!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,17,Thank you all! he said.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,18,You're welcome and happy birthday! said the gift givers.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,19,Sister's gift was thoughtful.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,20,"But she was being thoughtful in another way, too."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,21,It isn't always easy when your brother gets a lot of presents and you don't.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,22,Sister understood that she had gotten presents when it was her birthday and would again.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,23,"Besides, she wasn't that interested in aluminum bats, warm-up jackets, fielder's gloves, sports videos, or balsa wood, anyway."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,24,But all that changed when Mama and Papa Bear gave Brother their present.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,25,"It was the biggest, most beautiful racing bike Sister had ever seen."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,26,"It had a hand brake, three speeds, and super-sport wheels."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,27,"When Sister saw that beautiful bike, it was no longer, Happy birthday, Brother! It was, I gotta have that bike!"
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,28,I gotta!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,29,I gotta!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,30,I gotta!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,31,Mama saw that I-gotta-have-it look in Sister's eyes.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,32,She took her aside and reminded her about all the wonderful presents she had gotten on her last birthday.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,33,But Sister didn't hear a word Mama said.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,34,"She just stared at that big, beautiful bike with the hand brake and the super-sport wheels."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,35,"Oh, dear, said Mama."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,36,I think you've been taken over by the green-eyed monster.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,37,Green-eyed monster? said Sister.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,38,What's that?
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,39,"Oh, said Mama."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,40,That's just a way folks have of talking about jealousy and envy.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,41,You know what it means to be jealous.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,42,Envy is when you want something that belongs to somebody else.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,43,"But, Mama, said Sister."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,44,It's such a great beautiful bike!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,45,"Please listen to me, Sister, said Mama."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,46,"Even if you had a bike like that, you couldn't ride it."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,47,You're not big enough.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,48,Your feet wouldn't reach the pedals.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,49,"Besides, look what Papa's got for you."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,50,Papa was wheeling in Brother's junior-size bike with its training wheels attached.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,51,"It's yours now, he said."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,52,Sister looked at the bike Brother had outgrown.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,53,"It was okay, but it didn't have a hand brake, three speeds, and super-sport wheels."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,54,"Come on now, said Mama."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,55,Our guests are leaving.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,56,It's time to say good-bye.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,57,Good-bye! said Brother.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,58,Thank you all for the wonderful presents!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,59,"Bye, said Sister."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,60,Gramps and Gran got into their pickup truck and headed for home.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,61,Lizzy Bruin got into her dad's car with the others.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,62,Mr. Bruin had agreed to come for them and drive them home.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,63,Then papa helped carry the new bike down the front steps.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,64,Mama and papa watched proudly as Brother climbed on and tried it out.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,65,"First Brother rode big, fast circles around the tree house."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,66,Then he did a few wheelies.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,67,"When he started riding with his feet up on the handlebars, Mama got worried."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,68,Now let's not be reckless! she said.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,69,"Sister watched, too."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,70,She had gone inside and was watching from a window.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,71,As she did so she became filled with envy.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,72,"From the tips of her pink hair bow down to the tips of her toenails, Sister really wanted that big, beautiful racing bike."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,73,That night Sister was having trouble falling asleep because she was still thinking about the bike.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,74,Then just as her eyes were closing the strangest thing happened.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,75,She had a visitor.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,76,"The visitor looked exactly like Sister, except she was green and had little horns on her head."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,77,"I know who you are, Sister said."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,78,You're the green-eyed monster.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,79,"Sister was having a dream, of course."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,80,But she didn't know that.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,81,That's the thing about dreams.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,82,They're so real.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,83,"Come, said the green-eyed monster."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,84,"If you want a bike like Brother's, all you have to do is prove you're big enough to ride it."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,85,"Before she quite knew what was happening, she was up on the bike and the green-eyed monster was giving her a big push."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,86,The bike was much too big for her.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,87,Her feet couldn't even almost reach the pedals.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,88,"Then, as so often happens in dreams, things began to change."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,89,The bike got bigger and bigger and BIGGER!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,90,Now Sister was speeding down a hill.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,91,At the bottom was a great rock.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,92,She smashed into it.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,93,There was a huge crash!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,94,Brother's beautiful new birthday bike flew into a thousand pieces.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,95,What have I done? she screamed.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,96,What have I done?
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,97,"Mama and Papa, who had just fallen asleep, came running into the cubs' room."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,98,"Oh, Mama! cried Sister."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,99,I just smashed Brother's beautiful birthday bike into a thousand pieces!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,100,A thousand pieces!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,101,"Try to calm down, sweetie, said Mama."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,102,Brother's bike is perfectly safe.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,103,You were having a dream.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,104,"What's going on? said Brother, rubbing his eyes."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,105,"I'll go downstairs and get us all some warm milk, said Papa."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,106,It'll help us get back to sleep.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,107,And it did.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,108,"The next day Sister's best friend, Lizzy, came over to play."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,109,She and Sister had a fun time riding around the yard.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,110,Brother's old bike turned out to be just right for Sister.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,111,Lizzy had a good time on Sister's old trike.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,112,And Brother rode circles around them on his birthday bike.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,113,"Later, when Mr. Bruin came over to pick up Lizzy, he had a very big surprise for everybody."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,114,He had just traded in his old car for a beautiful brand-new one.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,115,And what a car it was!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,116,"It had wire wheels, leather seats, and racing stripes."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,117,"Mama, Brother, Sister, and Lizzy congratulated Mr. Bruin on his fine new car."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,118,But not Papa.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,119,He just stood and stared.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,120,He had the same I-gotta-have-it look that Sister had when she first saw Brother's new bike.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,121,"Papa, said Sister."
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,122,I think you better watch out for ‘you know who'!
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,123,Papa did know who.
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,124,"Mr. Bruin, he said, congratulations on a fine new car!"
M87,THE BERENSTAIN BEARS AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER,STAN & JAN BERENSTAIN,125,"After the Bruins drove away, Mama and Papa sat on the tree house steps and watched Brother and Sister do some plain and fancy bike riding."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,1,Elizabeth was a beautiful princess.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,2,She lived in a castle and had expensive princess clothes.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,3,She was going to marry a prince named Ronald.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,4,"Unfortunately, a dragon smashed her castle, burned all her clothes with his fiery breath, and carried off Prince Ronald."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,5,Elizabeth decided to chase the dragon and get Ronald back.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,6,"She looked everywhere for something to wear, but the only thing she could find that was not burnt was a paper bag."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,7,So she put on the paper bag and followed the dragon.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,8,He was easy to follow because he left a trail of burnt forests and horses' bones.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,9,"Finally, Elizabeth came to a cave with a large door that had a huge knocker on it."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,10,She took hold of the knocker and banged on the door.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,11,"The dragon stuck his nose out of the door and said, Well, a princess!"
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,12,"I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,13,I am a very busy dragon.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,14,Come back tomorrow.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,15,He slammed the door so fast that Elizabeth almost got her nose caught.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,16,Elizabeth grabbed the knocker and banged on the door again.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,17,"The dragon stuck his nose out of the door and said, Go away."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,18,"I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,19,I am a very busy dragon.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,20,Come back tomorrow.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,21,"Wait, shouted Elizabeth."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,22,Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,23,"Yes, said the dragon."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,24,"Fantastic, said Elizabeth, and the dragon took another huge breath and breathed out so much fire that he burnt up one hundred forests."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,25,"Magnificent, said Elizabeth, and the dragon took another huge breath, but this time nothing came out."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,26,The dragon didn't even have enough fire left to cook a meatball.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,27,"Elizabeth said, Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?"
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,28,"Why, yes, said the dragon, and jumped up and flew all the way around the world in just ten seconds."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,29,"He was very tired when he got back, but Elizabeth shouted, Fantastic, do it again!"
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,30,So the dragon jumped up and flew around the whole world in just twenty seconds.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,31,"When he got back he was too tired to talk, and he lay down and went straight to sleep."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,32,"Elizabeth whispered, very softly, Hey, dragon."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,33,The dragon didn't move at all.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,34,She lifted up the dragon's ear and put her head right inside.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,35,"She shouted as loud as she could, Hey, dragon!"
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,36,The dragon was so tired he didn't even move.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,37,Elizabeth walked right over the dragon and opened the door to the cave.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,38,There was Prince Ronald.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,39,"He looked at her and said, Elizabeth, you are a mess!"
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,40,"You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled and you are wearing a dirty old paper bag."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,41,Come back when you are dressed like a real princess.
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,42,"Ronald, said Elizabeth, your clothes are really pretty and your hair is very neat."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,43,"You look like a real prince, but you are a bum."
M88,THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS,ROBERT N. MUNSCH,44,They didn't get married after all.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,1,"Once upon a time, a little girl named Laura lived in the Big Woods of Wisconsin in a little house made of logs."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,2,"Laura lived in the little house with her Pa, her Ma, her big sister Mary, her baby sister Carrie, and their good old bulldog Jack."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,3,Winter was coming to the Big Woods.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,4,Soon the little house would be covered with snow.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,5,"Pa went hunting every day so that they would have meat during the long, cold winter."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,6,"Ma, Laura, and Mary gathered potatoes and carrots, beets and turnips, cabbages and onions, and peppers and pumpkins from the garden next to the little house."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,7,"By the time winter came, the little house was full of good things to eat."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,8,Laura and Mary thought the attic was a lovely place to play.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,9,"They played house by using the round orange pumpkins as tables and chairs, and everything was snug and cozy."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,10,"Soon the first snow came, and it was very cold."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,11,In the mornings the windows were covered with beautiful frost pictures of trees and flowers and fairies.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,12,Ma said that Jack Frost came in the night and made the pictures while everyone was asleep.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,13,Laura and Mary were allowed to use Ma's thimble to make pretty patterns of circles in the frost.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,14,In the mornings Laura and Mary helped Ma wash the dishes and make the beds.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,15,"After this was done, Ma began the work that belonged to that day."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,16,Each day had its own proper work.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,17,Ma would say
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,18,"Wash on Monday, Iron on Tuesday, mend on Wednesday, churn on Thursday, clean on Friday, bake on Saturday, rest on Sunday."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,19,Laura liked the churning and baking days best of all.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,20,Ma had to churn the cream for a long time until it turned into butter.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,21,"Mary could sometimes churn while Ma rested, but Laura was too little."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,22,"On Saturdays, when Ma made the bread, Laura and Mary each had a little piece of dough to make into a little loaf."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,23,Ma even gave them a bit of cookie dough to make little cookies.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,24,"After the day's work was done, Ma would sometimes cut out paper dolls for Laura and Mary."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,25,"She drew their faces on with a pencil, and cut dresses, hats, and ribbons out of colored paper so that Mary and Laura could dress their dolls beautifully."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,26,"But the best time of all was at night, when Pa came home."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,27,"He would throw off his fur cap and coat and mittens and call, Where's my little half-pint of sweet cider half drunk up?"
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,28,"That was Laura, because she was so small."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,29,Sometimes Pa would take down his fiddle and sing.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,30,Pa would keep time with his foot.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,31,Laura and Mary would clap their hands to the music when he sang:
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,32,"Yankee Doodle went to town, He wore his striped trousies, he swore he couldn't see the town, there was so many houses."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,33,Other times Pa would tell stories.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,34,"When Laura and Mary begged him for a story, he would take them on his knees and tickle their faces with his long whiskers until they laughed out loud."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,35,His eyes were blue and merry.
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,36,"Outside it was cold and snowy, but the little log cabin was snug and cozy."
M89,WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS,LAURA INGALLS WILDER,37,"Pa, Ma, Laura, Mary, and Baby Carrie were comfortable and happy in their little house in the Big Woods."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,1,Angelina absolutely loved snowy winter days when she could ice skate with her friends on Miller's Pond.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,2,"The ice sparkled like glass and they raced across it in pairs, practicing spins and twirls and figure-eights."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,3,"Everyone in the village was getting ready for New Year's Eve, and Angelina was preparing a special ice skating show."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,4,"Her little cousin Henry wanted to be in the show, too, even though he often tumbled off the ice and fell into the snowbanks."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,5,"We'll need someone to be the Snow King, said Angelina's friend Flora, pirouetting across the ice as the Snow Princess."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,6,"I'll be the King! shouted Henry, but then he tripped and slid into Alice, who was going to be the Snow Fairy."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,7,You'd be a better snow shovel! said Alice crossly as she dusted off her skates.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,8,"Don't worry, Henry, said Angelina."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,9,Hold on to me and let's practice skating together.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,10,"They linked their tails and tried to skate in a circle, but it wasn't easy on the slippery ice."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,11,"Just then Spike and Sammy, two big boys from school, raced by playing hockey and almost knocked them all over."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,12,"HEY! shouted Felicity, but the boys were already gone, laughing and yelling across the ice."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,13,"Never mind, said Angelina, helping Felicity get her balance."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,14,Let me show you how to skate backwards.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,15,"But, before long, Spike and Sammy tore past again, spraying snow in all directions."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,16,"When they zipped through Angelina's rehearsal a third time, she got angry."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,17,Please stop interrupting us! she scolded.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,18,"But the boys just laughed, grabbed Angelina's scarf, and tweaked Flora's whiskers."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,19,Little ballerinas can't catch us! they shouted as they zoomed away.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,20,"Angelina and her friends chased Spike and Sammy all across the ice, and then Angelina made a huge snowball and hurled it at the boys."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,21,Great!
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,22,"A snowball fight! Spike yelled, throwing one back at Angelina."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,23,"Then everybody started throwing snowballs everywhere, and soon Miller's Pond was a blizzard of flying snow and shouting skaters."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,24,"They had so much fun, they stayed until Flora got ice down her neck and Alice's toes began to freeze."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,25,"Then they trudged back to Angelina's house, feeling tired and frozen."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,26,What's wrong? asked Angelina's mother.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,27,"Our New Year's Eve Ice Dance is a mess, said Angelina sadly."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,28,We haven't got costumes or scenery and Spike and Sammy keep bothering us.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,29,"I can help you with costumes, said Mrs. Mouseling."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,30,And maybe the boys are teasing you because they want you to pay attention to them.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,31,Angelina was surprised.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,32,That gives me an idea.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,33,"The next day Angelina put on her skates and whizzed past Spike and Sammy, snatched their caps, and raced off laughing with the boys just behind her."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,34,"They were very fast, but Angelina could do all sorts of tricky twists and spins and, just as Spike and Sammy thought they would grab her, she spun out of reach and they smashed into each other, collapsing on the ice."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,35,Spike gazed at Angelina in admiration.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,36,You ballerinas are fast!
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,37,"Would you like to be in our show? asked Angelina, tossing back their caps."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,38,Spike and Sammy leapt up.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,39,"Yes! they shouted, skating in circles around her."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,40,"Sammy loved doing funny tricks and Spike, who could skate backwards, was proud to be the Snow King."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,41,"Best of all, they helped Henry build a huge snow fort."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,42,"It will make a nice snow palace for our show, said Henry enthusiastically."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,43,What a great idea! admired Angelina.
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,44,"On New Year's Eve, the whole village dressed up and came to celebrate."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,45,"Miller's Pond looked magical as the performers skated on to the ice in Mrs. Mouseling's costumes, and Henry's snow fort gleamed in the moonlight."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,46,"When Angelina danced into the spotlight that night, she felt just like a real snow queen."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,47,"Spike and Sammy did exciting leaps and jumps together and Henry was thrilled to be the King's attendant, while Felicity, Flora, and Alice seemed to fly across the ice like delicate snowflakes."
M90,ANGELINA ICE SKATES,KATHARINE HOLABIRD,48,"At the end of the performance, as the magic hour of midnight approached and fireworks sparkled in the sky, Angelina and her friends wished everyone joy and peace, and they all sang and danced together to welcome in the New Year."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,1,"On the fifteenth of May, in the Jungle of Nool, in the heat of the day, in the cool of the pool, He was splashing. . .  enjoying the jungle's great joys. . .  When Horton the elephant heard a small noise."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,2,So Horton stopped splashing.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,3,He looked toward the sound.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,4,"That's funny, thought Horton."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,5,There's no one around.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,6,Then he heard it again!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,7,Just a very faint yelp as if some tiny person were calling for help.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,8,"I'll help you, said Horton."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,9,But who are you? Where? He looked and looked.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,10,He could see nothing there but a small speck of dust blowing past through the air.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,11,I say! murmured Horton.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,12,I've never heard tell of a small speck of dust that is able to yell.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,13,So you know what I think? . . .
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,14,"Why, I think that there must be someone on top of that small speck of dust!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,15,"Some sort of a creature of very small size, too small to be seen by an elephant's eyes. . .  some poor little person who's shaking with fear that he'll blow in the pool!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,16,He has no way to steer!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,17,I'll just have to save him.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,18,"Because, after all, a person's a person, no matter how small."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,19,"So, gently, and using the greatest of care, The elephant stretched his great trunk through the air, and he lifted the dust speck and carried it over and placed it down, safe, on a very soft clover."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,20,Humpf! humpfed a voice.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,21,‘Twas a sour kangaroo.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,22,And the young kangaroo in her pouch said Humpf! too.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,23,"Why, that speck is as small as the head of a pin."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,24,A person on that?
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,25,"Why, there never has been!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,26,"Believe me, said Horton."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,27,"I tell you sincerely, my ears are quite keen and I heard him quite clearly."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,28,I know there's a person down there.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,29,"And, what's more, quite likely there's two."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,30,Even three.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,31,Even four.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,32,"Quite likely. . .  a family, for all that we know!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,33,A family with children just starting to grow.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,34,"So, please, Horton said, as a favor to me, try not to disturb them."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,35,Just please let them be.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,36,"I think you're a fool! laughed the sour kangaroo and the young kangaroo in her pouch said, Me, too!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,37,You're the biggest blame fool in the Jungle of Nool!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,38,And the kangaroos plunged in the cool of the pool.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,39,What terrible splashing! the elephant frowned.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,40,I can't let my very small persons get drowned!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,41,I've got to protect them.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,42,I'm bigger than they.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,43,So he plucked up the clover and hustled away.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,44,"Through the high jungle tree tops, the news quickly spread:"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,45,He talks to a dust speck!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,46,He's out of his head!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,47,Just look at him walk with that speck on that flower!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,48,"And Horton walked, worrying, almost an hour."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,49,Should I put this speck down?. . .  Horton thought with alarm.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,50,"If I do, these small persons may come to great harm."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,51,I can't put it down.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,52,And I won't!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,53,After all a person's a person.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,54,No matter how small.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,55,Then Horton stopped walking.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,56,The speck-voice was talking!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,57,The voice was so faint he could just barely hear it.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,58,"Speak up, please, said Horton."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,59,He put his ear near it.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,60,"My friend, came the voice, you're a very fine friend."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,61,You've helped all us folks on this dust speck no end.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,62,"You've saved all our houses, our ceilings and floors."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,63,You've saved all our churches and grocery stores.''
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,64,"You mean. . .  Horton gasped, you have buildings there, too?"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,65,"Oh, yes, piped the voice. We most certainly do."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,66,"I know, called the voice, I'm too small to be seen but I'm Mayor of a town that is friendly and clean."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,67,"Our buildings, to you, would seem terribly small but to us, who aren't big, they are wonderfully tall."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,68,"My town is called Who-ville, for I am a who and we whos are all thankful and grateful to you."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,69,"And Horton called back to the Mayor of the town, You're safe now."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,70,Don't worry.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,71,I won't let you down.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,72,"But, just as he spoke to the Mayor of the speck, three big jungle monkeys climbed up Horton's neck!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,73,"The Wickersham brothers came shouting, What rot!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,74,This elephant's talking to Whos who are not!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,75,There aren't any Whos!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,76,And they don't have a Mayor!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,77,And we're going to stop all this nonsense!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,78,So there!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,79,They snatched Horton's clover!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,80,"They carried it off to a black-bottomed eagle named Vlad Vlad-i-koff, A mighty strong eagle, of very swift wing, And they said, Will you kindly get rid of this thing?"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,81,"And, before the poor elephant even could speak, that eagle flew off with the flower in his beak."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,82,"All that late afternoon and far into the night that black-bottomed bird flapped his wings in fast flight, while Horton chased after, with groans, over stones that tattered his toenails and battered his bones, and begged, please don't harm all my little folks, who have as much right to live as us bigger folks do!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,83,"But far, far beyond him, that eagle kept flapping and over his shoulder called back, Quit your yapping."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,84,I'll fly the night through.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,85,I'm a bird.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,86,I don't mind it.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,87,"And I'll hid this, tomorrow, where you'll never find it!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,88,And at 6:56 the next morning he did it.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,89,It sure was a terrible place that he hid it.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,90,He let that small clover drop somewhere inside of a great patch of clovers a hundred miles wide!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,91,Find that! sneered the bird.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,92,But I think you will fail.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,93,And he left with a flip of his black-bottomed tail.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,94,I'll find it! cried Horton.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,95,I'll find it or bust!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,96,I shall find my friends on my small speck of dust!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,97,"And clover, by clover, by clover he found that the one that he sought for was just not around."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,98,"And by noon poor old Horton, more dead than alive, had picked, searched, and piled up, nine thousand and five."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,99,"Then, on through the afternoon, hour after hour. . ."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,100,Till he found them at last!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,101,On the three millionth flower!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,102,My friends! cried the elephant.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,103,Tell me! Do tell!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,104,Are you safe?
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,105,Are you sound?
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,106,Are you whole?
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,107,Are you well?
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,108,From down on the speck came the voice of the Mayor:
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,109,We've really had trouble!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,110,Much more than our share.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,111,"When that black-bottomed birdie let go and we dropped, we landed so hard that our clocks have all stopped."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,112,Our tea-pots are broken.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,113,Our rocking-chairs smashed.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,114,And our bicycle tires all blew up when we crashed.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,115,"So, Horton, please! pleaded that voice of the Mayor's, Will you stick by us Whos while we're making repairs?"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,116,"Of course, Horton answered."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,117,Of course I will stick.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,118,I'll stick by you small folks through thin and through thick!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,119,Humpf! humpfed a voice!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,120,For almost two days you've run wild and insisted on chatting with persons who've never existed.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,121,Such carryings-on in our peaceable jungle!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,122,We've had quite enough of your bellowing bungle!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,123,"And I'm here to state, snapped the big kangaroo, That your silly nonsensical game is all through!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,124,"And the young kangaroo in her pouch said, Me, too!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,125,"With the help of the wickersham brothers and dozens of wickersham uncles and wickersham cousins and wickersham in-laws, whose help I've engaged, you're going to be roped!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,126,And you're going to be caged!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,127,"And, as for your dust speck. . .  hah!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,128,That we shall boil in a hot steaming kettle of beezle-nut oil!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,129,Boil it?. . .  gasped Horton!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,130,"Oh, that you can't do!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,131,It's all full of persons!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,132,They'll prove it to you!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,133,Mr. Mayor!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,134,Mr. Mayor! Horton called.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,135,Mr. Mayor! You've got to Prove now that you really are there!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,136,So call a big meeting.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,137,Get everyone out'
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,138,Make every who holler!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,139,Make every Who shout!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,140,Make every Who scream!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,141,"If you don't, every Who is going to end up in a Beezle-Nut stew!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,142,"And, down on the dust speck, the scared little Mayor Quick called a big meeting in Who-ville Town square."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,143,And his people cried loudly.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,144,They cried out in fear:
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,145,We are here!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,146,We are here!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,147,We are here!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,148,We are here!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,149,The elephant smiled:
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,150,That was clear as a bell.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,151,You kangaroos surely heard that very well.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,152,"All I heard, snapped the big kangaroo, was the breeze, and the faint sound of wind through the far-distant trees."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,153,I heard no small voices.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,154,And you didn't either.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,155,"And the young kangaroo in her pouch said, Me, neither."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,156,Grab him! they shouted.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,157,And cage the big dope!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,158,Lasso his stomach with ten miles of rope!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,159,Tie the knots tight so he'll never shake loose!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,160,Then dunk that dumb speck in the Beezle-Nut juice!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,161,Horton fought back with great vigor and vim but the wickersham gang was too many for him.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,162,They beat him!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,163,They mauled him!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,164,They started to haul
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,165,Him into his cage!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,166,But he managed to call To the Mayor:
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,167,Don't give up!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,168,I believe in you all!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,169,"A Person's a Person, no matter how small!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,170,And you very small persons will not have to die if you make yourselves heard!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,171,"So come on, now, and TRY!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,172,The Mayor grabbed a tom-tom.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,173,He started to smack it.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,174,"And, all over Who-ville, they whooped up a racket."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,175,They rattled tin kettles!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,176,"They beat on brass pans, On garbage pail tops and old cranberry cans!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,177,"They blew on bazookas and blasted great toots on clarinets, oom-pahs and boom-pahs and flutes!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,178,Great gusts of loud racket rang high through the air.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,179,They rattled and shook the whole sky!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,180,And the Mayor called up through the howling mad hullabaloo:
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,181,"Hey, Horton! How's this?"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,182,Is our sound coming through?
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,183,"And Horton called back, I can hear you just find."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,184,"But the kangaroos' ears aren't as strong, quite, as mine."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,185,They don't hear a thing!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,186,Are you sure all your boys are doing their best?
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,187,Are they ALL making noise?
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,188,Are you sure every who down in Who-ville is working?
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,189,Quick!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,190,Look through your town!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,191,Is there anyone shirking?
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,192,"Through the town rushed the Mayor, from the east to the west."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,193,But everyone seemed to be doing his best.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,194,Everyone seemed to be yapping or yipping!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,195,Everyone seemed to be beeping or bipping!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,196,"But it wasn't enough, all this ruckus and roar!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,197,He HAD to find someone to help him make more.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,198,He raced through each building!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,199,He searched floor-to-floor!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,200,"And, just as he felt he was getting nowhere, and almost about to give up in despair, he suddenly burst through a door and that Mayor discovered one shirker!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,201,"Quite hidden away in the Fairfax apartments (Apartment 12-J) A very small, very small shirker named Jo-jo was standing, just standing, and bouncing a yo-yo!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,202,Not making a sound!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,203,Not a yipp!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,204,Not a chirp!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,205,And the mayor rushed inside and he grabbed the young twerp!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,206,And he climbed with the lad up the Eiffelberg Tower.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,207,"This, cried the Mayor, is your town's darkest hour!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,208,The time for all Whos who have blood that is red to come to the aid of their country! he said.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,209,We've GOT to make noises in greater amounts!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,210,"So, open your mouth, lad!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,211,For every voice counts!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,212,Thus he spoke as he climbed.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,213,"Whey they got to the top, the lad cleared his throat and he shouted, Yopp!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,214,And that Yopp. . .
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,215,"That one small, extra Yopp put it over!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,216,"Finally, at last!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,217,From that speck on that clover their voices were heard!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,218,They rang out clear and clean.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,219,And the elephant smiled.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,220,Do you see what I mean?. . .
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,221,"They've proved they are persons, no matter how small."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,222,And their whole world was saved by the smallest of all!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,223,How true!
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,224,"Yes, how true, said the big Kangaroo."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,225,"And, from now on, you know what I'm planning to do?. . ."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,226,"From now on, I'm going to protect them with you!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,227,"And the young kangaroo in her pouch said, ME, TOO!"
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,228,From sun in the summer.
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,229,"From rain in when it's fall-ish, I'm going to protect them."
M91,HORTON HEARS A WHO!,DR. SEUSS,230,No matter how small-ish!
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,1,"It was breakfast time, and everyone was at the table."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,2,Father was eating his egg.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,3,Mother was eating her egg.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,4,Gloria was sitting in a high chair and eating her egg too.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,5,Frances was eating bread and jam.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,6,What a lovely egg! said Father.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,7,"If there is one thing I am fond of for breakfast, it is a soft-boiled egg."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,8,"Yes, said Mother, spooning up egg for the baby. it is just the thing to start the day off right."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,9,"Ah! said Gloria, and ate up her egg."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,10,Frances did not eat her egg.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,11,She sang a little song to it.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,12,She sand the song very softly:
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,13,"I do not like the way you slide,"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,14,"I do not like your soft inside,"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,15,"I do not like you lots of ways,"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,16,And I could do for many days
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,17,Without eggs.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,18,"What did you say, Frances? Asked Father."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,19,"Nothing, said Frances, spreading jam on another slice of bread."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,20,"Why do you keep eating bread and jam, asked Father, when you have a lovely soft-boiled egg?"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,21,"One of the reasons I like bread and jam, said Frances, is that it does not slide off your spoon in a funny way."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,22,"Well, of course, said Father."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,23,not everyone is fond of soft-boiled eggs for breakfast.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,24,But there are other kinds of eggs.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,25,There are sunny-side-up and sunny-side-down eggs.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,26,"Yes, said Frances."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,27,But sunny-side-up eggs lie on the plate and look up at you in a funny way.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,28,And sunny-side-down eggs just lie on their stomachs and wait.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,29,What about scrambled eggs? said Father.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,30,Scrambled eggs fall off the fork and roll under the table. Said Frances.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,31,"I think it is time for you to go to school now, said Mother."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,32,"Frances picked up her books, her lunch box, and her skipping rope."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,33,Then she kissed Mother and Father good-bye and went to the bus stop.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,34,While she waited for the bus she skipped and sang:
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,35,"Jam on biscuits, jam on toast, Jam is the thing that I like most."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,36,"Jam is sticky, jam is sweet,"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,37,"Jam is tasty, jam's a treat-"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,38,"Raspberry, strawberry, gooseberry, I'm very FOND . . . OF . . . JAM!"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,39,"That evening for dinner, Mother cooked breaded veal cutlets with string beans and baked potatoes."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,40,Ah! said Father.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,41,What is there handsomer on a plate and tastier to eat than breaded veal cutlet!
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,42,"It is a nice dish, isn't it? said Mother."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,43,"Eat up the string bean, Gloria."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,44,"Oh! said Gloria, and ate it up."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,45,"She had already eaten her dinner of strained beef and sweet potatoes, but she liked to practice with a string bean when she could."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,46,Where do breaded veal cutlets come from? asked Frances.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,47,And why are French-cut stringless beans called string beans?
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,48,"We can talk about that another time, said Father."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,49,Now it is time to eat our dinner.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,50,Frances looked at her plate and sang:
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,51,What do cutlets wear before they're breaded?
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,52,Flannel nightgowns?
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,53,Cowboy boots?
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,54,Furry jackets?
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,55,Sailor suits?
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,56,Then she spread jam on a slice of bread and took a bite.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,57,"She won't try anything new, said Mother to Father."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,58,She just eats bread and jam.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,59,How do you know what you'll like if you won't even try anything? asked Father.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,60,"Well,' said Frances,"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,61,"there are many different things to eat, and they taste many different ways."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,62,"But when I have bread and jam I always know what I am getting, and I am always pleased."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,63,"You try new things in your school lunches, said Mother."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,64,Today I gave you a chicken-salad sandwich.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,65,"There, now! said Father to Frances."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,66,Wasn't it good?
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,67,"Well, said Frances, I traded it to Albert."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,68,For what? said Father.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,69,"Bread and jam, said Frances."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,70,"The next morning at breakfast Father sat down and said, Now I call that a pretty sight!"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,71,Fresh orange juice and poached eggs on toast.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,72,There's a proper breakfast for you!
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,73,"Thank you for saying so, said Mother."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,74,"Poached eggs on toast do have a cheery look, I think."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,75,Frances began to sing a poached-egg song:
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,76,"Poached eggs on toast, why do you shiver With such  a funny little quiver?"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,77,Then she looked down and saw that she did not have a poached egg.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,78,"I have no poached egg, said Frances."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,79,I have nothing but orange juice.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,80,"I know, said Mother."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,81,Why is that? said Frances.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,82,Everybody else has a poached egg.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,83,Even Gloria has a poached egg and she is nothing but a baby.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,84,"But you do not like eggs, said Mother, and that is why I did not poach one for you."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,85,Have some bread and jam if you are hungry.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,86,So Frances ate bread and jam and went to school.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,87,When the bell rang for lunch Frances sat down next to her friend Albert.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,88,What do you have today? said Frances.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,89,"I have a cream cheese-cucumber-and-tomato sandwich on rye bread, said Albert."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,90,And a pickle to go with it.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,91,And a hard-boiled egg and a little cardboard shaker of salt to go with that.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,92,And a thermos bottle of milk.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,93,And a bunch of grapes and a tangerine.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,94,And a cup custard and a spoon to eat it with.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,95,What do you have?
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,96,Frances opened her lunch.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,97,"Bread and jam, she said, and milk."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,98,"You're lucky, said Albert."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,99,That's just what you like.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,100,You don't have to trade now.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,101,"That's right, said Frances."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,102,And I had bread and jam for dinner last night and for breakfast this morning.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,103,"You certainly are lucky, said Albert."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,104,"Yes, said Frances."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,105,"I am a very lucky girl, I guess."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,106,But I'll trade you if you want to.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,107,"That's all right, said Albert."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,108,I like cream cheese with cucumbers and tomatoes on rye.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,109,Albert took two napkins from his lunch box.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,110,He tucked one napkin under his chin.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,111,He spread the other one on his desk like a tablecloth.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,112,He arranged his lunch neatly on the napkin.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,113,With his spoon he cracked the shell of the hard-boiled egg.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,114,He peeled away the shell and bit off the end of the egg.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,115,He sprinkled salt on the yolk and set the egg down again.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,116,He unscrewed his thermos-bottle cup and filled it with milk.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,117,Then he was ready to eat his lunch.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,118,"He took a bite of sandwich, a bite of pickle, a bite of hard-boiled egg, and a drink of milk."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,119,Then he sprinkled more salt on the egg and went around again.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,120,"Albert made the sandwich, the pickle, the egg, and the milk come out even."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,121,He ate his bunch of grapes and his tangerine.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,122,"Then he cleared away the crumpled-up waxed paper, the eggshell, and the tangerine peel."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,123,He set the cup custard in the middle of the napkin on his desk.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,124,He took up his spoon and ate up all the custard.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,125,Then Albert folded up his napkins and put them away.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,126,He put away his cardboard saltshaker and his spoon.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,127,He screwed the cup on top of his thermos bottle.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,128,"He shut his lunch box, put it back inside his desk, and sighed."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,129,"I like to have a good lunch, said Albert."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,130,Frances ate her bread and jam and drank her milk.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,131,Then she went out to the playground and skipped rope.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,132,"She did not skip as fast and she had skipped in the morning, and she sang:"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,133,"Jam in the morning, jam at noon,"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,134,Bread and jam by the light of the moon.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,135,Jam . . . is . . . very . . . nice.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,136,"When Frances got home from school, Mother said, I know you like to have a little snack when you get home from school, 'and I have one all ready for you."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,137,"I do like snacks! said Frances, running to the kitchen."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,138,"Here it is, said Mother."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,139,A glass of milk and some nice bread and jam for you.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,140,Aren't you worried that maybe I will get sick and all my teeth will fall out from eating so much bread and jam? asked Frances.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,141,"I don't think that will happen for quite a while, said Mother."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,142,So eat it all up and enjoy it.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,143,"Frances ate up most of her bread and jam, but she did not eat all of it."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,144,After her snack she went outside to skip rope.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,145,"Frances skipped a little more slowly than she had skipped at noon, and she sang:"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,146,"Jam for snacks and jam for meals, I know how a jam jar feels-"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,147,FULL . . . OF . . . JAM!
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,148,That evening for dinner Mother cooked spaghetti and meatballs with tomato sauce.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,149,"I am glad to see there will be enough for second helpings, said Father."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,150,Because spaghetti and meatballs is one of my favorite dishes.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,151,"Spaghetti and meatballs is a favorite with everybody, said Mother."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,152,"Try a little spaghetti, Gloria."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,153,"Um, said Gloria, and tried the spaghetti."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,154,Frances looked down at her plate and saw that there was no spaghetti and meatballs on it.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,155,There was a slice of bread and a jar of jam.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,156,Frances began to cry.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,157,My goodness! said Mother.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,158,Frances is crying!
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,159,What is the matter? asked Father.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,160,Frances looked down at her plate and sang a little sad song.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,161,She sang so softy that Mother and Father could scarcely hear her:
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,162,What I am
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,163,Is tired of jam.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,164,"I want spaghetti and meatballs, said Frances."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,165,"May I have some, please?"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,166,I had no idea you liked spaghetti and meatballs! said Mother.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,167,"How do you know what I'll like if you won't even try me? asked Frances, wiping her eyes."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,168,"So Mother gave Frances spaghetti and meatballs, and she ate it all up."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,169,"The next day when the bell rang for lunch, Albert said, What do you have today?"
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,170,"Well, said Frances, laying a paper doily on her desk and setting a tiny vase of violets in the middle of it, let me see."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,171,She arranged her lunch on the doily.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,172,"I have a thermos bottle with cream of tomato soup, she said."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,173,And a lobster-salad sandwich on thin slices of white bread.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,174,"I have celery, carrot sticks, and black olives, and a little cardboard shaker of salt for the celery."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,175,And two plums and a tiny basket of cherries.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,176,And vanilla pudding with chocolate sprinkles and a spoon to eat it with.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,177,"That's a good lunch, said Albert."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,178,I think it's nice that there are all different kinds of lunches and breakfasts and dinners and snacks.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,179,I think eating is nice.
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,180,"So do I, said Frances, and she made the lobster-salad sandwich, the celery, the carrot sticks, and the olives come out even."
M92,BREAD AND JAM FOR FRANCES,RUSSELL HOBAN,181,The End

M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,1,Five stories about two great friends
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,2,Story number one
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,3,Split pea soup
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,4,Martha was very fond of making split pea soup.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,5,Sometimes she made it all day long.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,6,Pots and pots of split pea soup.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,7,"If there was one thing that George was not fond of, it was split pea soup."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,8,"As a matter of fact, George hated split pea soup more than anything else in the world."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,9,But it was so hard to tell Martha.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,10,"One day after George had eaten ten bowls of Martha's soup, he said to himself,  I just can't stand another bowl."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,11,Not even another spoonful.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,12,"So, while Martha was out in the kitchen, George carefully poured the rest of his soup into his loafers under the table."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,13,Now she will think I have eaten it.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,14,But Martha was watching from the kitchen.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,15,How do you expect to walk home with your loafers full of split pea soup? she asked George.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,16,"Oh dear, said George."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,17,You saw me.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,18,And why didn't you yell me that you hate my split pea soup?
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,19,"I didn't want to hurt your feelings, said George."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,20,"That's silly, said Martha."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,21,Friends should always tell each other the truth.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,22,"As a matter of fact, I don't like split pea soup very much myself."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,23,I only like to make it.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,24,"From now on, you'll never have to eat that awful soup again."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,25,What a relief! George sighed.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,26,Would you like some chocolate chip cookies instead? asked Martha.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,27,"Oh, that would be lovely, said George."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,28,"Then you shall have them, said his friend."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,29,Story Number Two
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,30,The Flying Machine
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,31,I'm going to be the first of my species to fly! said George.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,32,They why aren't you flying? asked Martha.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,33,It seems to me that you are still on the ground.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,34,"You are right, said George."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,35,I don't seem to be going anywhere at all.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,36,"Maybe the basket is too heavy, said Martha."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,37,"Yes, said George, I think you are right again."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,38,"Maybe if I climb out, the basket will be lighter."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,39,Oh dear! cried George.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,40,Now what have I done?
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,41,There goes my flying machine!
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,42,"That's all right, said Martha."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,43,I would rather have you down here with me.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,44,Story number three
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,45,George was fond of peeking in windows.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,46,One day George peeked in on Martha.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,47,He never did that again.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,48,"We are friends, said Martha."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,49,But there is such a thing as privacy!
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,50,Story number four
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,51,The mirror
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,52,"How I love to look at myself in the mirror, said Martha."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,53,"Every chance she got, Martha looked at herself in the mirror."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,54,Sometimes Martha even woke up during the night to look at herself.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,55,The is fun.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,56,She giggled.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,57,But George was getting tired of watching Martha look at herself in the mirror.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,58,"One day, George pasted a silly picture he had drawn of Martha onto the mirror."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,59,What a scare it gave Martha.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,60,Oh dear! she cried.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,61,What has happened to me?
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,62,"That's what happens when you look at yourself too much in the mirror, said George."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,63,"Then I won't do it ever again, said Martha."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,64,And she didn't.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,65,The last story
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,66,The tooth
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,67,"One day when George was skating to Martha's house, he tripped and fell."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,68,And he broke off his right front tooth.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,69,His favorite tooth too.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,70,"When he got to Martha's, George cried his eyes out."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,71,Oh dear me! he cried.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,72,I look so funny without my favorite tooth!
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,73,"There, there, said Martha."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,74,The next day George went to the dentist.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,75,The dentist replaced George's missing tooth with a lovely gold one.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,76,"When Martha saw George's lovely new golden tooth, she was very happy."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,77,George! she exclaimed.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,78,You look so handsome and distinguished with your new tooth!
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,79,And George was happy too.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,80,"That's what friends are for, he said."
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,81,They always look on the bright side and they always know how to cheer you up.
M94,GEORGE AND MARTHA,JAMES MARSHALL,82,"But they also tell you the truth, said Martha with a smile."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,1,The Lupine Lady lives in a small house overlooking the sea.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,2,In between the rocks around her house grow blue and purple and rose-colored flowers.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,3,The Lupine Lady is little and old.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,4,But she has not always been that way.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,5,I know.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,6,"She is my great-aunt, and she told me so."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,7,"Once upon a time she was a little girl named Alice, who lived in a city by the sea."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,8,From the front stoop she could see the wharves and the bristling masts of tall ships.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,9,Many years ago her grandfather had come to America on a large sailing ship.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,10,"Now he worked in the shop at the bottom of the house, making figureheads for the prows of ships, and carving Indians out of wood to put in front of cigar stores."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,11,For Alice's grandfather was an artist.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,12,"He pained pictures, too, of sailing ships and places across the sea."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,13,"When he was very busy, Alice helped him put in the skies."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,14,In the evening Alice sat on her grandfather's knee and listened to his stories of faraway places.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,15,"When he had finished, Alice would say, When I grow up, I too will go to faraway places, and when I grow old, I too will live beside the sea."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,16,"That is all very well, little Alice, said her grandfather, but there is a third thing you must do."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,17,What is that? asked Alice.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,18,"You must do something to make the world more beautiful, said her grandfather."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,19,"All right, said Alice."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,20,But she did not know what that could be.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,21,In the meantime Alice got up and washed her face and ate porridge for breakfast.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,22,She went to school and came home and did her homework.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,23,And pretty soon she was grown up.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,24,Then my Great-aunt Alice set out to do the three things she had told her grandfather she was going to do.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,25,She left home and went to live in another city far from the sea and the salt air.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,26,"There she worked in a library, dusting books and keeping them from getting mixed up, and helping people find the ones they wanted."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,27,Some of the books told her about faraway places.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,28,People called her Miss Rumphius now.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,29,Sometimes she went to the conservatory in the middle of the park.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,30,"When she stepped inside on a wintry day, the warm moist air wrapped itself around her, and the sweet smell of jasmine filled her nose."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,31,"This is almost like a tropical isle, said Miss Rumphius."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,32,But not quite.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,33,"So Miss Rumphius went to a real tropical island, where people kept cockatoos and monkeys as pets."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,34,"She walked on long beaches, picking up beautiful shells."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,35,"One day she met the Bapa Raja, king of a fishing village."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,36,"You must be tired,  he said."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,37,Come into my house and rest.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,38,So Miss Rumphius went in and met the Bapa Raja's wife.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,39,The Bapa Raja himself fetched a green coconut and cut a slice off the top so that Miss Rumphius could drink the coconut water inside.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,40,"Before she left, the Bapa Raja gave her a beautiful mother-of-pearl shell on which he had painted a bird of paradise and the words, You will always remain in my heart."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,41,"You will always remain in mine too, said Miss Rumphius."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,42,My great-aunt Miss Alice Rumphius climbed tall mountains where the snow never melted.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,43,She went through jungles and across deserts.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,44,She saw lions playing and kangaroos jumping.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,45,And everywhere she made friends she would never forget.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,46,"Finally she came to the Land of the Lotus-Eaters, and there, getting off a camel, she hurt her back."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,47,"What a foolish thing to do, said Miss Rumphius."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,48,"Well, I have certainly seen faraway places."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,49,Maybe it is time to find my place by the sea.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,50,"And it was, and she did."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,51,From the Porch of her new house Miss Rumphius watched the sun come up; she watched it cross the heavens and sparkle on the water; and she saw it set in glory in the evening.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,52,"She started a little garden among the rocks that surrounded her house, and she planted a few flower seeds in the stony ground."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,53,Miss Rumphius was almost perfectly happy.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,54,"But there is still one more thing I have to do, she said."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,55,I have to do something to make the world more beautiful.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,56,But what?
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,57,"The world already is pretty nice, she thought, looking out over the ocean."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,58,The next spring Miss Rumphius was not very well.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,59,"Her back was bothering her again, and she had to stay in bed most of the time."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,60,The flowers she had planted the summer before had come up and bloomed in spite of the stony ground.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,61,"She could see them from her bedroom window, blue and purple and rose-colored."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,62,"Lupines, said Miss Rumphius with satisfaction."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,63,I have always loved lupines the best.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,64,I wish I could plant more seeds this summer so that I could have still more flowers next year.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,65,But she was not able to.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,66,After a hard winter spring came.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,67,Miss Rumphius was feeling much better.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,68,Now she could take walks again.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,69,"One afternoon she started to go up and over the hill, where she had not been in a long time."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,70,I don't believe my eyes! she cried when she got to the top.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,71,For there on the other side of the hill was a large patch of blue and purple and rose-colored lupines!
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,72,"It was the wind, she said as she knelt in delight."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,73,It was the wind that brought the seeds from my garden here!
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,74,And the birds must have helped!
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,75,Then Miss Rumphius had a wonderful ideal
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,76,She hurried home and got out her seed catalogues.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,77,She sent off to the very best seed house for five bushels of lupine seed.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,78,"All that summer Miss Rumphius, her pockets full of seeds, wandered over fields and headlands, sowing lupines."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,79,She scattered seeds along the highways and down the country lanes.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,80,She flung handfuls of them around the schoolhouse and back of the church.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,81,She tossed them into hollows and along stone walls.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,82,Her back didn't hurt her any more at all.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,83,Now some people called her That Crazy Old Lady.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,84,The next spring there were lupines everywhere.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,85,Fields and hillsides were covered with blue and purple and rose-colored flowers.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,86,They bloomed along the highways and down the lanes.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,87,Bright patches lay around the schoolhouse and back of the church.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,88,Down in the hollows and along the stone walls grew the beautiful flowers.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,89,"Miss Rumphius had done the third, the most difficult thing of all!"
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,90,"My Great-aunt Alice, Miss Rumphius, is very old now."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,91,Her hair is very white.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,92,Every year there are more and more lupines.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,93,Now they call her the Lupine Lady.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,94,"Sometimes my friends stand with me outside her gate, curious to see the old, old lady who planted the fields of lupines."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,95,"When she invites us in, they come slowly."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,96,They think she is the oldest woman in the world.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,97,Often she tells us stories of faraway places.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,98,"When I grow up, I tell her, I too will go to faraway places and come home to live by the sea."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,99,"That is all very well, little Alice, says my aunt, but there is a third thing you must do."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,100,What is that? I ask.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,101,You must do something to make the world more beautiful.
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,102,"All right, I say."
M95,MISS RUMPHIUS,BARBARA COONEY,103,But I do not know yet what that can be.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,1,"August 27, 1935"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,2,"Dear Uncle Jim,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,3,Grandma told us after supper that you want me to come to the city and live with you until things get better.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,4,"Did she tell you that Papa has been out of work for a long time, and no one asks Mama to make dresses anymore?"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,5,"We all cried, even Papa."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,6,But them Mama made us laugh with her stories about your chasing her up trees when you were both little.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,7,Did you really do that?
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,8,"I'm small, but strong, and I'll help all I can."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,9,"However, Grandma said to finish my schoolwork before doing anything else."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,10,"Your niece,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,11,Lydia Grace Finch
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,12,"September 3, 1935"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,13,"Dear Uncle Jim,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,14,I'm mailing this from the train station.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,15,I forgot to tell you in the last letter three important things that I'm too shy to say to your face:
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,16,1. I know a lot about gardening but nothing about baking.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,17,"2. I'm anxious to learn to bake, but is there any place to plant seeds?"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,18,3. I like to be called Lydia Grace - just like Grandma.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,19,"Your niece,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,20,Lydia Grace Finch
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,21,On the train
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,22,"September 4, 1935"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,23,"Dear Mama,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,24,I feel so pretty in your dress that you made over for me.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,25,I hope you don't miss it too much.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,26,"Dear Papa,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,27,I haven't forgotten what you said about recognizing Uncle Jim:
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,28,Just look for Mama's face with a big nose and a mustache!
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,29,I promise not to tell him.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,30,(Does he have a sense of humor?)
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,31,"And, dearest Grandma,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,32,Thank you for the seeds.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,33,"The train is rocking me to sleep, and every time I doze off, I dream of gardens."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,34,"Love to all,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,35,Lydia Grace
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,36,"September 5, 1935"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,37,"Dear Mama and Papa and Grandma,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,38,I'm so excited!!!
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,39,There are window boxes here!
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,40,"They look as if they've been waiting for me, so now we'll both wait for spring."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,41,"And, Grandma, the sun shines down on the corner where I'll live and work."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,42,"Love to all,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,43,Lydia Grace
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,44,P.S. Uncle Jim doesn't smile.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,45,"December 25, 1935"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,46,"Dear Mama, Papa and Grandma,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,47,I adore the seed catalogues you sent for Christmas.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,48,"And, Grandma, thank you for all the bulbs."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,49,I hope you received my drawings.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,50,I wrote a long poem for Uncle Jim.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,51,"He didn't smile, but I think he liked it."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,52,"He read it aloud, then put it in his shirt pocket and patted it."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,53,"Love to all,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,54,Lydia Grace
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,55,"February 12, 1936"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,56,"Dearest Grandma,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,57,Thank you again for those bulbs you sent at Christmas.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,58,You should see them now!
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,59,"I really like Ed and Emma Beech, Uncle Jim's friends who work here."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,60,"When I first arrived, Emma told me she'd show me how to knead bread if would teach her the Latin names of all the flowers I know."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,61,"Now, just half a year later, I'm kneading bread and she's speaking Latin!"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,62,More good news: We have a store cat named Otis who at this very moment is sleeping at the foot of my bed.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,63,"Love to all,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,64,Lydia Grace
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,65,"P.S. Uncle Jim isn't smiling yet, but I'm hoping for a smile soon."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,66,"March 5, 1936"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,67,"Dear Mama, Papa, and Grandma,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,68,I've discovered a secret place.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,69,You can't imagine how wonderful it is.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,70,"No one else knows about it, but Otis."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,71,I have great plans.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,72,Thank you for all the letters.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,73,"I'll try to write more, but I'm really busy planting all your seeds in cracked teacups and bent cake pans!"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,74,"And Grandma, you should smell the good dirt I'm bringing home from the vacant lot down the street."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,75,"Love to all,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,76,Lydia Grace
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,77,"April 27, 1936"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,78,"Dearest Grandma,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,79,All the seeds and roots are sprouting.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,80,"I can hear you saying, April showers bring May flowers."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,81,Emma and I are sprucing up the bakery and I'm playing a great trick on Uncle Jim.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,82,"He sees me reading my mail, planting seeds in the window boxes, going to school, doing my homework, sweeping the floor."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,83,But he never sees me working in my secret Place.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,84,"Love to all,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,85,Lydia Grace
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,86,P.S. I'm planning on a big smile from Uncle Jim in the near future.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,87,"May 27, 1936"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,88,"Dear Mama, Papa, and Grandma,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,89,You should have heard Emma laugh today when I opened your letter and dirt fell out onto the sidewalk!
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,90,Thank you for all the baby plants.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,91,They survived the trip in the big envelope.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,92,More about Emma: She's helping me with the secret place.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,93,Hurrah!
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,94,"Love to all,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,95,Lydia Grace
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,96,P.S. I saw Uncle Jim almost smile today.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,97,"The store was full (well, almost full) of customers."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,98,"June 27, 1936"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,99,"Dear Grandma,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,100,Flowers are blooming all over the place.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,101,"I'm also growing radishes, onions, and three kinds of lettuce in the window boxes."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,102,"Some neighbors have brought containers for me to fill with flowers, and a few customers even gave me plants from their gardens this spring!"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,103,They don't call me Lydia Grace anymore.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,104,They call me the gardener.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,105,"Love to all,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,106,Lydia Grace
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,107,P.S. I'm sure Uncle Jim will smile soon.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,108,I'm almost ready to show him the secret place.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,109,"July 4, 1936"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,110,"Dearest Mama, Papa, and Grandma,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,111,I am bursting with happiness!
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,112,"The entire city seems so beautiful, especially this morning."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,113,The secret place is ready for Uncle Jim.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,114,"At noon, the store will close for the holiday, and then we'll bring him up to the roof."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,115,I've tried to remember everything you ever taught me about beauty.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,116,"Love to all,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,117,Lydia Grace
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,118,P.S. I can already imagine Uncle Jim's smile.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,119,You've arrived
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,120,Please go up
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,121,"July 11, 1936"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,122,"Dear Mama, Papa, and Grandma,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,123,My heart is pounding so hard I'm sure the customers can hear it downstairs!
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,124,"At lunch today, Uncle Jim put the Closed sign on the door and told Ed and Emma and me to go upstairs and wait."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,125,He appeared with the most amazing cake I've ever seen – covered in flowers!
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,126,I truly believe that cake equals one thousand smiles.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,127,And then he took your letter out of his pocket with the news of Papa's job!
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,128,I'm coming home!
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,129,"Love to all, and see you soon,"
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,130,Lydia Grace
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,131,"P.S. Grandma, I've given all of my plants to Emma."
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,132,I can't wait to help you in your garden again.
M96,THE GARDENER,SARAH STEWART,133,We gardeners never retire.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,1,Winter was on the way.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,2,Lisa took her woolen clothes out of the chest and carried them outside.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,3,"She was hanging them up in the fresh air, when a strong wind blew one of her stockings off the line."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,4,Curious Hedgie found it and poked his nose in.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,5,"When he pulled it out, the stocking was stuck on his prickles."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,6,"How embarrassing, Hedgie thought."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,7,The mother hen came by with her chicks.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,8,"Cackle, cackle, she clucked, and laughed."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,9,"What's that on your head, Hedgie?"
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,10,"Why, it's me new hat, he told her."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,11,Isn't it beautiful?
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,12,The mother hen cocked her head as if she had an idea.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,13,And off she ran.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,14,Hedgie saw the noisy gander looking down at him.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,15,"Honk, honk!"
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,16,"Ho, ho, ho! the gander laughed."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,17,Look at that!
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,18,The hedgehog has flipped his gizzard.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,19,"Laugh today, Gander."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,20,"But tomorrow when it rains, my hat will keep me dry."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,21,The gander thought for a moment.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,22,And off he ran.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,23,The barn cat was watching from a tree as Hedgie tugged at the stocking.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,24,"Meow, he called down."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,25,"What a silly-looking hedgehog you are, with that thing on your head."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,26,But my ears will be warm in a snowstorm.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,27,"Hmmmmm, purred the cat."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,28,And off he ran.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,29,The farm dog and her puppies found Hedgie in a patch of brambles.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,30,"Hedgie, is that a hat you're wearing?"
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,31,"How funny you look, she barked, and her puppies yelped and giggled."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,32,"But I'll be cozy and dry when it snows, Hedgie said."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,33,The farm dog's ears perked up.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,34,And off she ran.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,35,"Oink, oink! the piglets squealed."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,36,"What are you up to, Hedgie? the mama pig asked."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,37,Making sure my hat doesn't fall off if an icy wind blows up.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,38,"I see, said the mama pig."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,39,And off she ran.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,40,"Hedgie, what is that ridiculous thing on your head? the pony snorted at Hedgie."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,41,That was the last straw.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,42,"It's my hat, of course."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,43,Don't you know that everyone should wear a hat in the winter when it's cold and snowy! Hedgie shouted.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,44,The pony looked startled.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,45,Hedgie was usually so friendly.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,46,And off he ran.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,47,Hedgie just wanted to be alone.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,48,"He was tired of everyone laughing at him, and with this thing on his head, he wouldn't even fit in his den."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,49,"He didn't see Lisa running after him, the other stocking in her hand."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,50,"Come back, you silly hedgehog, she called."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,51,"Oh, no, Hedgie thought."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,52,Even the girl is laughing at me!
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,53,Lisa caught up and pulled her stocking off Hedgie's head.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,54,"You ridiculous little hedgehog, she laughed."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,55,Don't you know that animals don't wear clothes!
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,56,"Hedgie headed for his den, and Lisa started back toward the clothesline."
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,57,That's when she saw all of her missing woolens.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,58,"The animals had taken them and each one was thinking, Now I am wearing a magnificent hat!"
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,59,Lisa was still chasing them when Hedgie reached his den.
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,60,How ridiculous they look!
M97,THE HAT,JAN BRETT,61,Don't they know that animals should never wear clothes!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,1,Arnie turned out to be just the kind of doughnut he hoped he's be – chocolate-covered with bright-colored candy sprinkles.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,2,Look at all my sprinkles – there must be a million of them!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,3,"Actually, there are only 135, but I'm not going to spoil it for him."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,4,He was made very early in the morning at the Downtown Bakery – Home of the Best Doughnuts A-‘Round'!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,5,Arnie was proud to be one of the best.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,6,He knew that people all over town made special trips to his bakery to buy doughnuts of their very own.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,7,Get it?

M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,10,Give me a minute – I'm good at these.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,11,"As Arnie sat on the tray, which had just been placed in the doughnut case, he took a moment to reflect on the amazing things that had happened to him that morning."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,12,I remember that . . . .

M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,23,"I'm soaking in boiling grease, but I love it!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,24,"Your drink, sir."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,25,Thanks.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,26,Who's that handsome doughnut?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,27,Hold still.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,28,That tickles!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,29,Caution sprinkle area – must wear safety goggles.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,30,"Whatever I'm named, I'm going to go by cool iced-D"

M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,47,Hello Long John!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,48,Jelly-filled
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,49,EEEOOO! His brains are oozing out!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,50,"It's not brains, silly - it's jelly!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,51,Double checking
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,52,OOO is it brain?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,53,"Nah, it's Jelly."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,54,Cinnamon twist

M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,60,Bear claw
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,61,"He tried to strike up a conversation with an apple fritter on the next tray over, but she didn't seem to want to talk."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,62,Glazed
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,63,Apple fritter
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,64,How ‘bout that deep fryer? . . .
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,65,Any relation to Larry Fritter? . . .
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,66,Want to count my sprinkles?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,67,It us rather early.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,68,"Maybe she's not a morning doughnut, Arnie supposed."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,69,Various muffins
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,70,Steel-belted radial doughnut
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,71,"Okay, now I get it . . . round"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,72,It was 6 a.m. and the baker had just hung the open sign in the window.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,73,Arnie was fascinated as he watched customers stream into the bakery.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,74,"One by one, doughnuts were chosen, placed in paper bags, and whisked away with their new owners."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,75,Some went by the dozen in giant boxes.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,76,RRRR- must be a day-old doughnut
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,77,Must . . .have . . . doughnuts
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,78,Oh she – he gives me the heavy end.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,79,"I've been sent to collect the tasty, fried, sweet crystal-coated cake disks."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,80,Is this the proper coordinate?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,81,Number 105!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,82,Good-bye! Arnie yelled to each doughnut.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,83,Have a great trip!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,84,"Do you promise to love, honor and cherish this doughnut until the very last bite?"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,85,I do.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,86,"Look, Grandma – this one matches your dress!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,87,Doughnuts make good wheel.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,88,This is so exciting! I wonder who will choose me?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,89,"Just them, Arnie looked up and saw a man pointing right at him!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,90,Moi?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,91,Moi (pronounced mwah) is the French word for me.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,92,He learned it from moi.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,93,"Before he could say another word, he was pulled form the tray and placed in a paper bag of his very own."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,94,"Good-bye, everyone!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,95,"Thank you, Mr. Bing."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,96,Have a nice day!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,97,Arnie heard the baker say to the man.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,98,"Mr. Bing . . . that's a fine name, Arnie decided."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,99,I can hardly wait to meet him!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,100,Good-bye Arnie!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,101,We'll miss you!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,102,Arnie
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,103,I should have talked to him while I had the chance.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,104,(the grand exit that Arnie's imagining)
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,105,The ride to Mr. Bing's apartment was a little bumpy.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,106,Arnie was grateful for the soft napkin the baker had so thoughtfully placed underneath him in the bag.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,107,Jump!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,108,You're outta there!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,109,Bumps
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,110,More Bumps
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,111,Bumpy Humps
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,112,He had never ridden in a car and wished he could look out the window to see all the sights.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,113,"Nut more than anything, he wished he could meet Mr. Bing."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,114,Why does he keep me in this bag? Arnie wondered.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,115,Grump on a stump
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,116,Get those words off my lawn!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,117,Clumps of bumps
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,118,Bumps and lumps
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,119,"Finally, the car came to a stop and they were home."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,120,"Mr. Bing carefully removed Arnie from his paper bag and placed him on a clean, shiny plate."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,121,"What a handsome plate, Arnie said to himself."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,122,I'm not crazy about the design – I prefer a more modern look.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,123,But it's nothing a little paint can't fix.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,124,Chocolate Milk
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,125,Mr. Bing gently lifted Arnie from his new plate.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,126,"Isn't that cute? thought Arnie, as he closed his eyes and smiled."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,127,He wants to hold me.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,128,"As Arnie relaxed in Mr. Bing's hand, he felt himself moving higher and higher away from his plate."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,129,"When he opened his eyes to see where he was going, he discovered that he was headed straight for Mr. Bing's open mouth!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,130,What are you doing? shouted Arnie.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,131,Mr. Bing was stunned.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,132,He dropped Arnie back onto the plate.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,133,"I was going to . . . eat you, he replied in shock."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,134,"EAT ME? Arnie shrieked, his sprinkles flying everywhere."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,135,Why would you do a thing like that?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,136,Do you make a habit of eating all your houseguests?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,137,Nnnno . . . of course not.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,138,"So, why then did it suddenly occur to you to eat ME? Arnie demanded."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,139,Well . . . because . . . you're a doughnut.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,140,That's what doughnuts are for – to eat.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,141,Do you mean to tell me you've done this before?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,142,"Yes . . . I eat a doughnut every day, Mr. Bing said sheepishly."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,143,Arnie froze.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,144,He felt sick and frightened and angry!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,145,Ugggh!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,146,I'd better get out of here before he tries to eat me again!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,147,"Well, That explains why my friends never write or call - they've probably all been EATEN!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,148,He thought to himself for a moment.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,149,I must put a stop to this right away!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,150,I'll call the bakery and warn the others.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,151,"Whoever's LEFT, that is!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,152,Arnie knew that there was no time to waste and that he needed to be very sneaky in order to keep his plan from Mr. Bing.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,153,"He turned to Mr. Bing and said in his sweetest voice, Excuse me, sir, but I don't believe we've been properly introduced."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,154,My name is Arnie.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,155,"Um . . . hello . . . Arnie, Mr. Bing stammered."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,156,It's nice to eat you – I mean meet you.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,157,"Mr. Bing, would you be a dear and allow me to use your telephone?"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,158,Arnie asked extra politely.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,159,"Oh . . . well . . . okay, said Mr. Bing, and he handed Arnie the phone."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,160,"As quickly as he could, Arnie dialed the number of the bakery."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,161,(still shocked to actually be talking to a doughnut!)
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,162,The baker answered the phone.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,163,"Downtown Bakery, home of the best"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,164,Mr. Baker Man! Arnie frantically whispered.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,165,This is Arnie the doughnut.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,166,Do you remember me?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,167,"You made me at 5:15 this morning, and I was bought about twenty minutes ago by a man who goes by the name of Br. Bing."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,168,"Yes, Arnie, the baker answered."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,169,‘What can I do for you?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,170,"Now, I don't want to alarm you, but just moments ago, that man tried to eat me!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,171,And not only that – he claims to have eaten hundreds of us!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,172,"I'm going to make a run for it, but I wanted to warn you so that if you see him coming into the bakery again, you can stop him!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,173,"Oh my, Arnie-I thought you understood."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,174,That's why I make doughnuts . . . for people to eat.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,175,I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! Arnie gasped.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,176,Are the other doughnuts aware of this arrangement?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,177,"well, I think so, the baker said."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,178,Let me ask them to make sure.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,179,Showing signs of doughnut shock
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,180,Popped-up eyebrow sprinkles
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,181,Bugged-out eyeballs
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,182,Overall dazed expression
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,183,Severe sprinkle loss
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,184,Weak in the knees
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,185,Feels like someone punched a hole right through him
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,186,"The baker yelled to the other doughnuts, DO YOU DOUGHNUTS KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE EATEN?"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,187,"YES, we know! the doughnuts shouted back."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,188,We're DELICIOUS!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,189,We're very popular!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,190,People love us!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,191,C'est magnifique
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,192,Try us for yourself!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,193,Is he going a little kooky?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,194,Kooky or cookie?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,195,Did you hear that Arnie? the baker asked.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,196,Arnie was crushed.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,197,The phone dropped from his hand.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,198,He'd heard all he needed to hear.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,199,Arnie forgot all about his plan to escape.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,200,"He collapsed back onto the plate, glanced up at Mr. Bing, and muttered, All right then, let's get this over with."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,201,Go ahead and eat me.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,202,"Mr. Bing gazed down at Arnie.  I'm not going to eat you, Arnie, he said reassuringly."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,203,I just wouldn't feel right about it now.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,204,"REALLY? Arnie said, with a huge sigh of relief."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,205,"Well, I'm glad to see that you've come to your senses!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,206,"But since I'm not going to eat you, Mr. Bing continues, I'll have to figure our something else to do with you."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,207,I paid good money for you – I don't want to be wasteful.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,208,Of course not! Arnie agreed.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,209,What we need to do is each make a list of things I can do with you instead of eating you.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,210,"Between the two of us, I know we'll come up with something."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,211,"Good plan, Mr. Bing! Arnie said."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,212,This will be a breeze-I bet I'm good at lots of stuff!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,213,They both feverishly wrote down their ideas.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,214,"When they were finished, Mr. Bing asked, Would you like to read yours first?"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,215,"Sure thing, Mr. Bing! Arnie answered."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,216,Things Mr. Bing can do with me instead of eating me
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,217,Do you need a ballroom dance partner?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,218,"No, I don't dance."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,219,You could use a personal fitness trainer.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,220,Drop and give me 20!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,221,"Hmmmmm, I'd get too sweaty."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,222,How about a portrait painter?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,223,"oh, heavens no!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,224,Would you like me to entertain at your parties?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,225,I wonder if he does weddings.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,226,Doughnut make my brown eyes bluuuue . . .
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,227,He's fabulous!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,228,Wherever did you find him?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,229,I don't like throwing parties.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,230,I could be your chauffeur.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,231,Look out for that tree!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,232,Relax.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,233,But you can't see over the steering wheel.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,234,I'd make a great bodyguard!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,235,Who could you protect me from – a cookie?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,236,"That's close enough, Ma'am."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,237,"All righty, Mr. Bing."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,238,Let's hear what you came up with!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,239,"Okey-dokey, he replied."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,240,I just know you'll like some of these.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,241,Things I can do with Arnie instead of eating him
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,242,I could use you as a pincushion.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,243,Ouch!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,244,"Ooooh, too painful."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,245,How about an air freshener for my car?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,246,Hi Arnie – you smell good enough to eat!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,247,How about not?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,248,Would you like to be a picture frame?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,249,I don't imagine so.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,250,I need a new bowling ball.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,251,"Well, don't look at me!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,252,"Yea, Arnie!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,253,You'd make a fine paperweight.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,254,"Keep up the good work, Arnie!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,255,BORING!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,256,Hat about a doorstop?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,257,"Thanks, Arnie!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,258,Try again.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,259,But there was nothing else on Mr. Bing's list.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,260,They were both completely out of ideas.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,261,Arnie and Mr. Bing were exhausted.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,262,They felt terribly disappointed.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,263,"After a few minutes of awkward silence, Mr. Bing finally spoke."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,264,"I'm sorry, Arnie- but it's clear that we can't agree on anything for you to do around here."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,265,"This is difficult for me to say, but I think it would be best if you found another home."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,266,"I know, said Arnie, fighting back tears."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,267,I'll just be on my way then.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,268,Is it all right if I keep this napkin to pack up all my loose sprinkles?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,269,"Of course, Mr. Bing replied sadly."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,270,"As soon as I get a job, I'll pay you back the money you spent on me."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,271,"That's not necessary, Arnie."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,272,Good-bye Arnie- we've got some lovely parting gifts for you.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,273,Arnie shook Mr. Bing's hand and thanked him for his kindness.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,274,"Mr. Bing opened the door, and as Arnie left he paused and said, I guess doughnuts really are only good for eating, aren't they?"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,275,They both waved good-bye and Arnie was gone.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,276,Mr. Bing stood at the window and watched as Arnie walked away.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,277,"He walked past the flower beds, the mailboxes, and the apartment manager's office."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,278,You can have my limited-time offer for an interest-free credit card.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,279,No mail for me.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,280,Office
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,281,Now leasing
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,282,Is there anything worse than a sad pastry?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,283,Remember how happy I was at the beginning of the story?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,284,"I can't read, but you sure looked happy."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,285,"He passed the tennis court, the swimming pool, and the clubhouse."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,286,"But when Arnie reached the NO DOGS ALLOWED sign at the end of the driveway, Mr. Bing suddenly came up with a new idea."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,287,Oopsie!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,288,Sometimes life feels like a big bonk on the head.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,289,"Technically, I'm food - so I guess a quick dip in the pool is out."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,290,No food in pool area.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,291,Is that a doughnut?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,292,"Yeah, whatever, anyway, about my trip abroad. . ."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,293,No dogs allowed
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,294,"Bye, Arnie"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,295,(the fastest Mr. Bing's moved in years)
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,296,Arnie!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,297,Arnie!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,298,Wait up! yelled Mr. Bing as he ran after him.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,299,Arnie turned back and stopped.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,300,"When Mr. Bing caught up with him, he was out of breath."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,301,I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier! Mr. Bing panted.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,302,"Arnie, I've always wanted a dog and could never have one because they're not allowed here."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,303,But there's no sign that says: NO DOUGHNUTS ALLOWED.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,304,Arnie perked up when he realized that Mr. Bing was thinking.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,305,Keep talkin' big guy.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,306,NO DOGS ALLOWED
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,307,Would you like to take walks and play fetch? Mr. Bing asked excitedly.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,308,You bet I would!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,309,"Can you do tricks, like rolling over?"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,310,Rolling over?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,311,LOOK AT ME- I was MADE For rolling over!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,312,"Well, then, there's only one thing left to ask."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,313,"Arnie, will you be my doughnut-dog?"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,314,"Oh, Mr. Bing- I would LOVE to be your doughnut-dog!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,315,"It's a WACKY idea, but it just might work!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,316,"From that moment on, Arnie and Mr. Bing were inseparable."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,317,Arnie liked being a doughnut-dog even better than he liked being a doughnot.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,318,"Get it, Arnie!"
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,319,Take pine.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,320,Pet groomers
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,321,Bye Arnie!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,322,Buy Mr. Bing!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,323,I got the DELUXE package!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,324,"He went through a short phase of chewing on furniture and barking at the mailman, but after a crash course in obedience school, he graduated first in his class."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,325,"Everywhere the two of them went, people would stop to pet Arnie."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,326,No one had ever seen a doughnut-dog before.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,327,Congratulations Arnie!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,328,Is that a doughnut-dog?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,329,What a darling man.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,330,What a darling dog!
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,331,"You're so sticky, yes you are."
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,332,I love that Arnie.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,333,Got a napkin?
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,334,Arnie and Mr. Bing had so much fun together.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,335,Arnie was the best pet Mr. Bing could ever have hoped for – and Mr. Bing was Arnie's best friend.
M98,ARNIE THE DOUGHNUT,LAURIE KELLER,336,Beware of Doughnut.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,1,Friday is errand day.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,2,"My mom goes on boring errands, and I have to go with her."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,3,And this Friday seemed like every other Friday . . . until we got to the bakery.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,4,A sign above the doughnuts read: Buy a dozen get a dinosaur.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,5,I couldn't believe my eyes.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,6,Neither could my mom.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,7,"They must mean a toy, she said."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,8,"But when I took the box of doughnuts, the lady behind the counter said, Hold on, little guy."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,9,Don't forget your dinosaur.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,10,And there he was!
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,11,Mom! I yelled.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,12,It was a triceratops.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,13,What! cried my mom.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,14,She did not look happy.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,15,How are we supposed to get that home?
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,16,The bakery lady smiled.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,17,"Oh, don't worry, he'll follow you."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,18,They always do.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,19,"And he did . . . all the way to the doctor's office, where I had to go for my checkup."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,20,My mom shook her head.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,21,What are we going to do with him now?
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,22,She looked him up and down.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,23,That took a while.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,24,"We can't bring him inside, she said finally."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,25,He'll have to stay in the parking lot.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,26,I told him not to talk to strangers.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,27,"After my checkup, I asked for a sticker, like usual."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,28,"No stickers today, said the nurse."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,29,Just dinosaurs.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,30,"With a shot, you get two."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,31,The nurse smiled.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,32,"Not today, buddy."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,33,But you can pick up your dinosaur at the front desk.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,34,Mom! I yelled.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,35,"There, at the front desk, was a stegosaurus."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,36,What on earth is going on? my mom cried.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,37,"It's a special day, the nurse explained."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,38,"Today, dinosaurs come with everything!"
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,39,Yessss! I said.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,40,"Noooo, my mom groaned."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,41,"We walked down the street, and my triceratops and my stegosaurus walked right behind us."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,42,"THUD, THUD, THUD."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,43,They made friends right away.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,44,"Across the street, other kids had dinosaurs too."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,45,"I saw an ankylosaur, a duckbill, and a velociraptor."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,46,We all waved at each other.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,47,Our mothers glared and kept on walking.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,48,"I think we'd better go home right now, my mom said."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,49,But what about my haircut?
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,50,The barber's waiting for me.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,51,My mom looked at the dinosaurs.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,52,Then she looked at my bangs.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,53,"The barber always gives you a balloon, doesn't he?"
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,54,A nice balloon?
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,55,"Uh-huh, I said."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,56,I didn't want a balloon.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,57,I wanted a barosaur.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,58,"At the barbershop, I gave my triceratops and my stegosaurus doughnuts for a snack."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,59,They waited outside and watched through the glass.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,60,The barber pumped the chair up high.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,61,"He cut my hair too short, but I didn't mind, because then he patted my head and said, Wait right here, sport.'"
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,62,He was gone for a long time.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,63,My mom tapped her foot.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,64,"I don't like this, she said."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,65,Where exactly do they keep the balloons?
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,66,"Just then, the barber came back with something flying over his head."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,67,It wasn't a balloon.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,68,Mom! I yelled.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,69,It was a pterosaur.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,70,"This is too much, my mom protested."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,71,"Now, listen, she said to the barber."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,72,I think a balloon will do just fine today.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,73,Don't you have any balloons?
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,74,"Sorry, lady."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,75,No balloons.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,76,You get one of these instead.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,77,It was like that everywhere we went.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,78,"At the shoe store, the sign read: BUY TWO PAIR, GET DINOSAUR FREE!"
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,79,My mom decided my shoes would last a while longer.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,80,"At the theater, we could hear the popcorn man shouting, Butter?"
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,81,No butter?
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,82,You want a dinosaur with that?
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,83,My mom said we'd go to the movies another day.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,84,"At the diner, I wanted to stop for a hamburger."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,85,But then a girl walked out with a Tyrannosaurus rex.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,86,"Okay, that's it! my mom cried."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,87,We are definitely not having lunch there.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,88,"She looked at my triceratops, my stegosaurus, and my pterosaur."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,89,What are we supposed to do with all of these dinosaurs?
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,90,We don't have room for them!
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,91,We can't take care of them!
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,92,I hugged her leg.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,93,"Don't worry, Mom."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,94,They can live in the backyard!
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,95,My mom shook her head.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,96,"Sweetheart, they're not toys."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,97,Dinosaurs are a lot of work.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,98,"But, Mom, look!"
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,99,They eat anything.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,100,And they sleep outside.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,101,"I'll do everything, I promise."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,102,"Please, Mom?"
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,103,Please? My mom sighed.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,104,"Well, I suppose we can't just leave them here."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,105,Thank heavens we didn't stop at the diner.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,106,"We hurried home, and my dinosaurs hurried after us."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,107,"THUD, THUD, THUD."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,108,"FLAP, FLAP, FLAP."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,109,"When we were almost there, we saw a little duckbill dinosaur, standing alone on the street corner."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,110,He looked lost.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,111,"Mom, that's a baby hadrosaur."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,112,He's all by himself!
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,113,"Sweetie, we've already got our hands full."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,114,The hadrosaur followed us.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,115,It wasn't my fault.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,116,"When we got home, my mom needed to lie down, so I made lunch for the dinosaurs."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,117,Then I showed them where to go to the bathroom.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,118,I told them to stay out of the neighbor's yard because of his mean dog.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,119,"And I showed them my slide, my tire swing, and all the toys in the garage."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,120,"They seemed to be having fun, but they really went wild when I took out my Frisbee."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,121,The hadrosaur had the first throw.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,122,The Frisbee landed on the roof.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,123,I saw my mom watching from the window.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,124,Is everything all right out there? she asked.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,125,"Everything's fine, Mom."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,126,We can get it down.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,127,And my pterosaur flew up and plucked the Frisbee out of the gutter.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,128,My mom kept watching.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,129,She looked at him for a long time.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,130,"The next thing I knew, she had him cleaning the gutters!"
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,131,Then she came out to the backyard with a pile of wet clothes.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,132,"These spikes come in handy, don't they, she said."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,133,"Pretty soon, my mom had thought of chores for all of my dinosaurs."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,134,But I knew they didn't mind.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,135,It just meant they were part of the family.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,136,"When we were finished helping, my mom said I could invite some friends over."
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,137,It was a bring-your-own-dinosaur party!
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,138,And guess what happened next?
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,139,I heard my mom on the phone to the bakery.
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,140,"She asked, Do you have any doughnuts left?"
M99,WHEN DINOSAURS CAME WITH EVERYTHING,ELISE BROACH,141,And that's when I knew everything would be just fine.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,1,The train leaves in minutes.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,2,Passengers buy tickets and rush across the floor to where the train is humming on its tracks.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,3,Conductors look up the platform.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,4,They check their watches.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,5,"One minute. Hats wave, whistles blow."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,6,All aboard! Not all.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,7,A passenger jumps on at the last second.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,8,The doors whoosh shut.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,9,The train pulls out of the station . . ..  and out of the city.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,10,The train is a red-striped Commuter Train.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,11,"The conductor swings down the aisle, shouts, Tickets please! and snaps holes in the tickets with his punch."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,12,"The train clatters past ball fields and bridges, past backyards and ponds."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,13,Main streets flash by.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,14,The view changes every second.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,15,"Hello town, good-bye town."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,16,On to the next town.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,17,The Commuter Train slows with creaking brakes.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,18,Announcements crackle.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,19,Some words get lost: We are arriving at Ghblighrrfzze.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,20,The train stops at a small station.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,21,"Passengers off, passengers on."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,22,"As the Commuter Train waits, another train roars past on another track."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,23,A larger train.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,24,A bright blue Passenger Train hurrying between cities.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,25,"The train is late so up in the cab of the engine, the engineer pulls back the throttle."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,26,The Passenger Train powers forward.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,27,It hurtles past barns and farmhouses.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,28,The engine is so big it makes other big things look small.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,29,The engineer sits very still but his fingers are always moving.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,30,"Pushing levers, turning dials."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,31,"He taps a blue button -long, long, short, long-and the horn blares out across a valley of fields and steeples."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,32,"As the train approaches a rail crossing, it sounds like a storm."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,33,"As the train passes, it sounds like dropped pots and pans."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,34,"As the train leaves, it sounds like the da dum da dum of a beating heart."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,35,"Then, silence."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,36,"But up ahead the Passenger Train keeps going, thundering into the outskirts of a Midwestern city filled with smokestacks and factories and belching steam."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,37,Tracks weave in and out.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,38,Small animals scurry under the tracks.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,39,"The Passenger Train crawls over the tracks through a jungle of gravel, wires, and dirt."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,40,Everything smells of grease and rust and burnt toast.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,41,The train lurches up to the station.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,42,"Bells ring, doors open."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,43,"Passengers off, passengers on."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,44,Tall men with red caps unload luggage and wheel it through the echoing hall.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,45,"In the rail yard next to the station, another train works."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,46,An orange Freight Train loading up.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,47,It grumbles under its breath as railcars are hauled and hitched to its back.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,48,"The railcars are filled with steel, concrete, oil, wheat, corn, and lumber."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,49,Things used to make other things.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,50,Sturdy things.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,51,All crammed in containers the color of tomatoes and eggs.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,52,Thick white letters cover the railcar sides.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,53,"Graffiti paints their sides, too."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,54,"After the railcars are linked into one long train, the Freight Train creeps out of the city and across the Great Plains."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,55,It rolls past wheat and prairie grasses.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,56,Past silos and barbed wire.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,57,Past a lone hawk circling under a big western sky.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,58,The Freight train rolls slower than slow.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,59,So slow it's hard to tell it's moving.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,60,As if the train and the clouds above were having a race to see which can go slower.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,61,"Slow, sloooow."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,62,"And like the clouds, the train does not stop even as it inches up among low hills."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,63,"Then, another train passes."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,64,A dark green Overnight Train switchbacking westward.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,65,It climbs over the Rocky Mountains through snow flurries and pine forests.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,66,The train curves along icy rivers and shoots through tunnels (where its chatter turns into a whisper).
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,67,There are no roads outside.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,68,"Just eagles, elk, and turkeys."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,69,"As the sun lowers, passengers gather in the dining car, where the waiter sways down the aisle with her tray."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,70,She doesn't spill a thing.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,71,"Plates of meat loaf, potatoes, ice cream, and pie."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,72,A movable feast.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,73,"In the sleeping car, two girls unfold seats into beds and make the room their own."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,74,"Little sink, little shower."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,75,Everything little.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,76,The girls sleep as the train curls through the mountains and into the night.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,77,The moon rises.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,78,"Wherever the train goes, the moon follows."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,79,"When the train stops, the moon stops."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,80,"When the train starts, the moon starts."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,81,Sometimes it hides behind a ridge.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,82,Then-hello friend- reappears.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,83,The train rests in small towns.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,84,"Passengers off, passengers on."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,85,"Stars blink in the cold air, lights blink on the horizon, and the Overnight Train pushes into the deep hours of the night and wakes to morning sun."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,86,"Passengers wake to biscuits, butter, jam, and coffee."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,87,"Outside, everything is different."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,88,"Mountains have turned into orchards, snow into grass, boulders into cattle."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,89,"Now, accelerating into view across a wide green valley, one last train passes."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,90,"A sleek and white High-Speed Train, blurring a streak across the land."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,91,Schwooosshhhh.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,92,The High-Speed Train flies.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,93,"It glides over bridges and marshes, by bays and highways."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,94,"Inside, it is cool and quiet."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,95,The train is a small world moving through a larger world.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,96,"Passengers read or type, One whispers in her phone: We're almost there."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,97,We'll see you soon.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,98,The High-Speed Train races toward the city on the coast and the passengers prepare for the end of their journey.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,99,"They close their books, they pack their bags, they think about what's next."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,100,"A clean bed, a warm dinner."
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,101,They are almost home.
M100,TRAIN,ELISHA COOPER,102,"And with a slowing turn into the station and an easing of speed and a sigh of brakes and a gentle last thunk, the train stops."
