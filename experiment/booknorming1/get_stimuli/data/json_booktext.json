In 1963 and again in 1975 Anno left his native Japan and journeyed through<br>many parts of Europe exploring, observing, painting and drawing as he went. He<br>found a world new to him, as it will be to many of his readers, but a world that is<br>deeply rooted in ancient traditions. This book is a record of that journey. Go with the<br>lone traveler on his way and you will encounter the paintings of the French<br>Impressionists, find musical notes from Beethoven\\'s Ninth, tilt at the windmill with<br>Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, help to pull up The Enormous Turnip.

At the end of the road there were always houses<br>gathered together to make a town, and in every town there were gates, leading from<br>shops to squares to plazas, through graveyards and gardens to churches and<br>cathedrals. One town had a castle in its midst; one castle was a town by itself.

We also had two cats, Sherlock<br>Holmes and Dr. Watson. It is partly because of<br>those cats that I remember so vividly the first time<br>I read THE CAT CLUB aloud to children.<br>I was on my way to the library one day when we<br>were expecting a class of second-graders from a<br>nearby school. Suddenly I heard a cat crying<br>behind me. It was Dr. Watson. I didn\\'t have time to<br>take him back home and I didn\\'t dare to leave him<br>for fear he might get lost, so I picked him up and<br>carried him into the library. Dr . Watson was used<br>to having books and people around him and he<br>settled himself comfortably on a table in front of<br>the children. They were delighted, of course, and<br>they loved THE CAT CLUB so much that I decided to<br>read it again the next day to the third-graders.<br>That day I hadn\\'t even had time to begin reading<br>before a girl raised her hand and said<br>reproachfully, \\\"When the second grade came, you had a CAT.\\\"<br>It really didn\\'t seem fair, so I hurried back to the<br>bookshop and got Sherlock Holmes. He too made<br>himself at home on the library table and greatly<br>amused the children by standing on his hind legs<br>and resting his front paws on the bookshelf above.<br>He seemed to be looking with interest at a copy of<br>THE CAT CLUB on display there. Then he settled<br>down for the story. The third grade love? it as much<br>as the second grade had. A few days later several<br>of the children came in to tell me that they were<br>organizing a Cat Club in their neighborhood; they<br>had already found thirty-seven cats who could join<br>I They wanted Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to<br>be in the club too, even if they couldn\\'t come to the<br>meetings. I signed their names and thus enrolled<br>them as Honorary Members of the Hudson<br>Avenue Cat Club.<br>As Miss Averill says, Jenny Linsky and the other<br>Cat Club members were real cats and she knew<br>them all. You will feel that you know them all too.<br>Once you have made the acquaintance of shy little<br>Jenny, wearing her red scarf, and big strong Pickles<br>in his fireman\\'s helmet, you are not likely to forget<br>them. Perhaps you will have favorites. My<br>favorite, next to Jenny Linsky, is Pickles.<br>There are other stories about the Cat Club that<br>are not included in this book. You can probably get<br>those in your library and I think you will want to,<br>if you love the stories as much as I do.<br>THE CAT CLUB OR THE LIFE AND TIMES OF JENNY LINSKY<br>In Captain Tinker\\'s garden, once upon a<br>time, there was a Cat Club. All the cats and<br>kittens in the neighborhood were members.<br>All but Jenny Linsky.<br>Jenny Linsky was a small black orphan<br>cat who lived with Captain Tinker. He had<br>found Jenny in the street where a dog was<br>chasing her. No one knew where she had<br>come from and the Captain took her home.<br>He was very kind to Jenny. She had cream<br>and chicken every night for supper. Her<br>coal black fur grew soft and glossy. Her<br>yellow eyes began to have a happy look.<br>On day the Captain said to her, \\\"You<br>and I must always be best friends.\\\"<br>That made Jenny\\'s heart beat fast.<br>But the Captain added gently, \\\"I think a<br>lite cat like you should go outdoors<br>sometimes and play. Lots of nice cats live in this<br>garden.\\\"<br>Jenny had often heard the Cat Club<br>singing after dark. \\\"They\\'d have fun,\\\" she thought.<br>But se was too shy to say \\\"hello\\\" to them.<br>\\\"Shy little cats need help,\\\" thought<br>Captain Tinker to himself.<br>Captain Tinker, who was an old sailor,<br>liked to make things and many years ago had<br>learned to knit. He knitted a woolen scarf<br>for Jenny - a bright red woolen scarf to go<br>with her black fur and yellow eyes.<br>How Jenny loved that scarf! How brave<br>she felt when she was wearing it! And one<br>fine night she put it on and went into the<br>garden.<br>It was a lovely garden full of flowers and<br>trees and bushes. On three sides were rows<br>of pink brick houses . On the other side was<br>a tall board fence that kept the dogs away.<br>Jenny and the Captain lived in the brick<br>house that was covered with ivy.<br>Jenny crept softly through the grass and<br>found a hiding place beneath a rosebush.<br>There she waited for the Cat Club. She<br>waited a long time.<br>Suddenly a slim white cat sped through<br>the grass, dashed up the maple tree and<br>began to sing. This was Concertina, the<br>Club Secretary. She sang:<br>Come all ye cats and kittens<br>With your whiskers and your mittens<br>Come a-running, come a-running<br>To the Cat Club Jamboree.<br>Mr. President came first.<br>Mr. President was a well-fed cat who<br>always wore a collar with his name and<br>number on a tag. He walked slowly out of his<br>brick house and took his place - the<br>\\\"Chair,\\\" he called it-on the meeting<br>ground beneath the maple tree.<br>The the others came. They came one by<br>one and two by two from darkened doorways<br>and over the tall board fence. They formed<br>a circle in front of Mr. President.<br>CONCERTINA, IN THE MAPLE TREE, GIVES THE<br>SIGNAL FOR THE CATS TO COME<br>Just before the meeting, MR. PRESIDENT speaks to his young nephew,<br>JUNIOR. The fluffy cat is BUTTERFLY. The twins are ROMULUS and<br>REMUS. The cat jumping over a flower is MACARONI. SOLOMON, the wise<br>cat who can read, sits on his books and watches the two great fighters,<br>SINBAD and THE DUKE. The two cats in earnest conversation are the<br>sweethearts, ARABELLA and ANTONIO.<br>Mr. President opened the meeting and<br>spoke a few brief words about a money<br>matter. Afterwards the Club moved to the<br>porch of Concertina\\'s house.<br>Jenny stretched her neck and peeping<br>through the rose leaves saw everything that<br>happened.<br>The spotted twin cats, Romulus and<br>Remus, crawled through the kitchen<br>window and returned with a large paper<br>package.<br>\\\"A feast! A fish!\\\" cried all the cats.<br>They tore off the paper and devoured the<br>fish.<br>After they had licked their paws and<br>whiskers, the lovely Persian cat, Butterfly,<br>brought out her nose flute and began to play.<br>The cats sang and danced and joked until<br>the wee small hours when ,one by one, the<br>Club went home.<br>The last cat to go was Jenny Linsky. She<br>had not dreamed that cats could have such<br>fun.<br>Night after night she crept into the garden<br>and watched the Cat Club from behind the<br>rosebush.<br>What clever cats they are!\\\" sighed Jenny.<br>\\\"All of them can do things. Look at<br>Butterfly. She plays a nose flute. Look at Macaroni.<br>He can dance on his hind legs. And what<br>can I do?\\\"<br>Poor little Jenny! There was nothing she<br>could do. But she was content to watch the<br>others at their fun and frolic.<br>One night her surprise, Romulus and<br>Remus who were going to the meeting,<br>poked their noses right into the rosebush<br>and cried gaily, \\\"Hi there, sister, you\\'re the<br>new cat, aren\\'t you?\\\"<br>The twins were in such lively spirits that<br>Jenny did not feel afraid.<br>\\\"Yes,\\\" she answered, \\\"I am Jenny<br>Linsky.\\\" \\\"Well Jenny, wouldn\\'t you like to join<br>the Cat Club?\\\" asked the twins.<br>They did not give her time to answer.<br>They whisked her off between them.<br>But when they reached the meeting<br>ground, fear overcame her. All the other<br>cats were there, staring at her with their<br>gleaming eyes, as if to say, \\\"And what can<br>you do, little black cat? WHAT CAN<br>YOU DO?\\\"<br>This was too humor Jenny. She gave<br>a yowl of terror and fled home.<br>Next morning Romulus and Remus went<br>to Jenny\\'s house, looked through the garden<br>window and called, \\\"Jenny! Jenny Linsky!<br>Jenny did not answer. She was lying on<br>a soapbox in the cellar.<br>The twins had come to cheer her up and<br>they went away, discouraged.<br>In the afternoon the Persian cat, the lovely<br>one named Butterfly, pressed her silky face<br>against the windowpane and called, \\\"Jenny!<br>Jenny Linsky!\\\"<br>Jenny Linsky did not answer. She was still<br>lying on the soapbox in the cellar.<br>Butterfly, too, went off discouraged.<br>In the evening the entire Cat Club,<br>singing loudly, trooped through the garden on<br>their way to Jenny\\'s house.<br>Mr. President came first.<br>Behind him walked Butterfly playing on<br>her nose flute.<br>Concertina followed. She had a high<br>soprano voice and led the singing, and behind<br>her, one by one or two by two, the singers<br>marched.<br>First came Romulus and Remus.<br>Next, Mr. President\\'s young nephew,<br>Junior, accompanied by Solomon, the<br>bookish cat.<br>The fancy dancer, Macaroni, followed.<br>He was waltzing.<br>Behind Macaroni came the sweethearts,<br>Arabella and Antonio.<br>Lastly marched the two great fighters,<br>Sinbad and the Duke.<br>All of them were singing:<br>Meow and a purr! We want her!<br>Jenny! Jenny! Jenny!<br>Alas! They sang too loudly.<br>A man who could not sleep threw down a<br>bucketful of water and broke up their fine<br>parade. The members scampered home to<br>dry their dripping fur.<br>Thy did not meet again until the<br>following night when they had other plans and did<br>not go to Jenny\\'s house. It was summer and<br>in the summer Cat Clubs are very busy.<br>So in the end the Club in Captain Tinker\\'s<br>garden quite for got poor Jenny Linsky.<br>Still, you cannot blame them. You cannot<br>expect other cats to think always of your<br>troubles.<br>Jenny who was ashamed of having run<br>away, now stayed indoors. Time dragged.<br>Now and then she played games with<br>Captain Tinker. But when night came and she<br>heard the cats in the garden, she longed to be<br>with them.<br>\\\"And that will never happen,\\\" she sighed.<br>\\\"They are too clever. All of them can do<br>things. What can I do? Nothing.\\\"<br>Time passed.<br>The birds flew south. The honeysuckle<br>and the rosebush lost their leaves.<br>Winter came and everything was frozen.<br>Then Captain Tinker flooded the garden<br>and made a pond where the boys and girls<br>could skate.<br>One day while Jenny watched the skating<br>from the window, she turned suddenly to<br>Captain Tinker.<br>\\\"I should love to skate,\\\" she said. \\\"That\\'s<br>something I could do.\\\"<br>Jenny was surprised that Captain Tinker<br>did not answer. She went to him and put her<br>paw upon his arm.<br>\\\"Captain,\\\" she said, \\\"if I could only have<br>some skates.\\\"<br>Captain Tinker remained silent. He sat<br>in his armchair, puffing at his pipe and<br>looking thoughtful. Jenny did not know that out<br>of the corner of his eye the Captain watched<br>her as she climbed the stairs.<br>Upstairs she hunted for skates in bureau<br>drawers and on the closet shelves. She found<br>nothing.<br>In the night while Captain Tinker was<br>asleep, Jenny came downstairs and searched<br>the downstairs closets.<br>She ransacked the drawer where Captain<br>Tinker kept his fishing tackle. She found<br>hooks and lines and corks - but no skates.<br>In November it snowed - the first snow<br>storm Jenny had ever seen. All afternoon<br>she watched the snowflakes falling.<br>By evening the garden was entirely white.<br>Jenny stole outdoors and hunted in the drifts.<br>She found snowflakes shaped like flowers<br>and stars and spiderwebs - but no skates.<br>I\\'m glad Jenny has gone outdoors at<br>last,\\\" thought Captain Tinker. \\\"Now we<br>shall see what we shall see.\\\"<br>Bright and early the following day the<br>Captain went to his workshop in the cellar.<br>He closed the door behind him and would<br>not let Jenny in. All morning she could hear<br>him tapping with his hammer.<br>The mysterious hammering and tapping<br>went on for many days. On Christmas Eve<br>Captain Tinker came upstairs with<br>something in his pocket. Jenny watched him as he<br>lit the Christmas candle and pulled back the<br>curtain.<br>\\\"The stars are out,\\\" said Captain Tinker,<br>looking at the sky.<br>As he said it, he took out of his pocket<br>four little --.<br>Could they be real?<br>Jenny stared.<br>She reached out and touched them - oh,<br>so gently - with her paw. They were real,<br>and they were silver, and they had sharp<br>shiny blades.<br>\\\"Ice skates!\\\" she whispered. \\\"Silver ice<br>skates! Oh, Captain...\\\"<br>The Captain strapped the skates on<br>Jenny\\'s paws. They fitted exactly. Her ankles<br>wobbled for a moment; then she felt quite<br>steady. Captain Tinker tied her scarf and she<br>went into the garden.<br>At the pond he hesitated.<br>\\\"Which paw goes first?\\\" she wondered.<br>She struck forward on her right front paw<br>and glided. Then with her left hind paw she<br>gave a shove and glided further. She began<br>to skim across the ice.<br>It was a pretty sight to see her skating<br>with her red muffler streaming, and her<br>bright skates flashing in the moonlight. She<br>cut figure eights and flowers and stars.<br>The Cat Club saw her. They were at the<br>other end of the pond and had been singing<br>Christmas carols. Their mouths hung open<br>and their bulging eyes were fixed on Jenny<br>Linsky.<br>No one in the Club had ever seen a cat<br>skate.<br>Suddenly Romulus and Remus cried,<br>\\\"Jenny! Jenny Linsky!\\\"<br>And all the other cats cried, \\\"Jenny!<br>Jenny Linsky!\\\"<br>She glided toward them.<br>Romulus and Remus dashed to meet her<br>and before she knew it she was standing in<br>front of Mr. President.<br>\\\"Mr. President,\\\" said Romulus and<br>Remus, \\\"we hope that this black cat, a friend<br>of ours, will now be asked to join the<br>Club.\\\"<br>Mr. President looked at Jenny with his<br>beady eyes.<br>\\\"What is your name?\\\" he asked.<br>\\\"Jenny Linsky,\\\" she replied<br>\\\"Where do you live?\\\"<br>\\\"In Captain Tinker\\'s house.\\\"<br>\\\"Can you do anything?\\\" asked Mr.<br>President.<br>\\\"I can skate,\\\" said Jenny proudly.<br>\\\"Yippetty-yip-yip-yip!\\\" cried all the cats.<br>When the cheering died down, Mr.<br>President addressed the Club, saying, \\\"The<br>question is, shall our distinguished guest, Miss<br>Jenny Linsky, who can skate, be asked to<br>join the Cat Club. All cats in favor raise a<br>right front paw.\\\"<br>Every member raised a right front paw.<br>\\\"All cats opposed kick a left hind leg.\\\"<br>No one kicked a left hind leg.<br>Two cats went into the bushes to count the<br>votes. They came back quickly and<br>whispered in Mr. President\\'s ear. Mr. President<br>looked satisfied.<br>He turned to Jenny.<br>MR. PRESIDENT<br>(his newest picture)<br>CAT CLUB EMBLEM<br>This emblem will be made<br>in little medals for the<br>members to wear on their<br>chests<br>Miss Jenny Linsky,\\\" said Mr. President,<br>\\\"the votes have been counted.

Have you any money?\\\"<br>\\\"No,\\\" said Jenny, \\\"I\\'m broke, too.\\\"<br>Jenny poked her paw in a crack in the<br>sidewalk, as if she hoped to find a penny.<br>When no coin appeared, she said,<br>\\\"Captain Tinker says that money isn\\'t<br>everything.\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'m not so sure,\\\" said Pickles.<br>He turned his big, spotted, yellow, face<br>toward the sky to find out about the weather.<br>The night was crystal clear. Up high the<br>moon was swimming like a great liquid<br>silver dollar. As for the stars, Pickles felt<br>that he could touch them if he held out<br>his paw.<br>\\'\\'All right,\\\" he said to Jenny. \\\"Let\\'s get<br>going. You lead the way.\\\"<br>\\\"Me lead?\\\" gulped Jenny.<br>She was jut a small black cat and very<br>shy. She had never been a leader.<br>\\\"Tell me where you want to go,\\\" said<br>Pickles briskly.<br>\\\"Let\\'s go and get Florio,\\\" said Jenny.<br>Florio lived around the corner. He was<br>a young, golden-haired cat who was as<br>handsome as a prince. Best of all, he was gentle<br>in his ways and very gay.<br>Florio was lying<br>upstairs on a satin<br>cushion when he<br>heard their soft<br>\\\"whoo hoos.\\\" He<br>stood up, pulled<br>back the window<br>curtain and gave<br>a silent signal.<br>A few minutes later Florio came out. He<br>had had to wait and slip out secretly. His<br>mistress would have died of fright if she<br>had known that he was on the sidewalks of<br>New York.<br>When Florio realized that Pickles was<br>wearing his fireman\\'s helmet and that Jenny<br>had on the red scarf that her master, Captain<br>Tinker, had knitted, he borrowed an Indian<br>feathered headdress from the doorman.<br>\\\"Hello,\\\" said Florio, as he joined his two<br>friends on the sidewalk. \\\"Are we going to<br>have a party?\\\"<br>\\\"Not unless you have some money,\\\"<br>Pickles answered.<br>\\\"I haven\\'t any money\\\" said the golden-<br>haired cat. \\\"I\\'m broke.\\\"<br>Pickles sighed.<br>But Jenny said, \\\"It would be fun to have<br>some fun.\\\"<br>Florio looked at Jenny.<br>\\\"Where would you like to go?\\\" he asked.<br>\\\"Oh, anywhere,\\\" said Jenny<br>Pickles said to her, \\\"Name one idea.\\\"<br>Jenny thought a moment. Se tried to<br>think what her master, Captain Tinker,<br>would do in such a situation.<br>\\\"Certainly he would do something,\\\"<br>Jenny told herself. \\\"He would think up<br>games or have a catnip hunt or something.\\\"<br>A bright idea flashed through her mind.<br>\\\"Let\\'s find a doorway and secret<br>passage!\\\" she cried. \\\"It might lead to an<br>enchanted palace!\\\"<br>\\\"And to hidden<br>treasure!\\\" Pickles cried.<br>\\\"And Indians!\\\" cried<br>Florio<br>They started down the street: Jenny with<br>her bright red scarf, Pickles with his<br>fireman\\'s helmet and Florio with his Indian<br>feathered headdress.<br>They walked on many streets all the<br>streets were lighted with electric lights. And<br>all the doors were locked.<br>After a while, Pickles was ready to go<br>home. Even Florio was growing<br>discouraged. But Jenny was having a wonderful<br>time. She had never been on the streets at<br>night. \\\"Oh, please,\\\" she begged, \\\"let\\'s go just a<br>little farther.\\\"<br>So they went a little farther, choosing<br>streets that were darker and more filled with<br>mystery and moonlight.<br>All of a sudden Jenny said, \\\"Do you hear<br>what I hear?\\\"<br>They listened.<br>They looked down a small side street<br>that had no light but the moonlight. Over<br>the rooftops rose the laughter of many cats.<br>\\\"It sounds like a party,\\\" said Pickles.<br>And he straightened his fireman\\'s helmet.<br>Florio straightened his Indian feathered<br>headdress and said, \\\"Yes, perhaps we\\'ll have<br>a party after all.\\\"<br>But the little black cat, Jenny Linsky,<br>did not say anything. She was too excited.<br>She had never been to a party.<br>After a moment Pickles said, \\\"You two<br>wait here. I\\'ll go and scout.\\\"<br>Pickles disappeared down the dark street,<br>came back shortly and said, \\\"I\\'ve found the<br>gate.\\\"<br>Then he led his two friends to a wooden<br>gate that was open just wide enough to let<br>a cat slip through . One by one they did slip<br>through and in the moonlight, in a big,<br>deserted yard, they saw what they were<br>looking for: a party, a party just for cats.<br>There were striped cats and yellow cats<br>and white and grey and speckled cats.<br>All of them were dancing in the silver<br>moonlight.<br>How their legs flashed! How their<br>whiskers glittered!<br>In the center of the party was a fluffy cat<br>who danced the tumba rumba.<br>\\\"That fluffy one must be Alice<br>Featherlegs,\\\" whispered Florio to Pickles.<br>Pickles whispered, \\\"You\\'re right. It is<br>Alice.\\\"<br>\\\"Alice Featherlegs!\\\"<br>Jenny had never seen her before. But she<br>had heard of Alice. What cat had not heard<br>of Alice Featherlegs, who was famous for<br>her beauty and the way she danced the<br>tumba rumba?<br>Before long Alice Featherlegs caught<br>sight of the three new arrivals. She ran over<br>to them, and her soft fur made a rustling<br>sound as she drew near.<br>How elegant and full of grace she<br>seemed! Jenny could not take her eyes away<br>from her.<br>But Alice did not even glance at Jenny.<br>Alice looked only at Florio and Pickles.<br>She acted just as if she never spoke to little<br>cats.<br>Alice\\'s behavior made poor Jenny feel<br>extremely small and plain.<br>Jenny could hear the fluffy creature say<br>to the two bigger cats, \\\"How wonderful of<br>you to come! I think we may have met<br>before. But anyway, will you join our party?\\\"<br>\\\"We should like to very much,\\\" said<br>Pickles, bowing like a fireman.<br>Then Pickles said, \\\"Miss Featherlegs,<br>may I present our friend, Jenny Linsky?\\\"<br>Alice answered in a far-off voice, \\\"My,<br>what a pretty little cat. But isn\\'t she too<br>young to dance the tumba rumba?\\\"<br>Jenny wanted to say, \\\"I don\\'t know how<br>to dance it. But I think I could learn.\\\"<br>Try as she would, Jenny could not make<br>the words come out. And before she knew<br>what had happened, she was sitting on the<br>top of an upturned basket.<br>\\\"This is just the place for Jenny,\\\" Alice<br>said to Pickles and Florio. \\\"She can watch<br>us dance, or she can take a nap.\\\"<br>Take a nap! What a horrid thing to say<br>to a little black cat at her first party.<br>Jenny sat absolutely still and held back<br>her tears.<br>Florio whose light paws tingled with the<br>music, said to Jenny, \\\"Please don\\'t worry.<br>We\\'ll only dance once.\\\"<br>And Pickles said to her, \\\"That\\'s true.<br>Then we\\'ll come right back to you.\\\"<br>Jenny watched her two best friends go<br>off with Alice Featherlegs. Immediately<br>they were the center of the party. Time was<br>nothing to them. Time is nothing to a cat<br>when he is dancing.<br>Pickles and Florio danced on and on.<br>Now and then they glanced at Jenny to<br>make sure that she was safe. They could see<br>her sitting safely on the basket, but they<br>could not see that she was lonely.<br>Jenny had never felt so sad in all her life.<br>She began to wish that she were at home<br>with her dear master, Captain Tinker. She<br>wished that she were sitting on the<br>Captain\\'s lap.<br>The Captain knew how to comfort her.<br>He always told her that her troubles could<br>be straightened out.<br>Right now it seemed that she could<br>al.most hear the Captain\\'s voice. It seemed to<br>her that he was saying, \\\"Jenny dear, don\\'t<br>sit there, feeling sorry for yourself. Get up<br>and do something. Get up and dance.\\\"<br>\\\"I don\\'t know how to dance the tumba<br>rumba,\\\" answered Jenny.<br>And the Captain said, \\\"Then dance the<br>dance I taught you.\\\"<br>The Captain meant the old-time sailor\\'s<br>dance: the sailor\\'s hornpipe.<br>Although Jenny had danced the sailor\\'s<br>hornpipe once or twice at home, she had<br>never danced it in public. So she climbed<br>down to practice it behind the basket. She<br>wanted to make sure that she knew all the<br>steps before she danced it in front of Alice<br>Featherlegs.<br>Jenny stood up on her left hind leg and<br>twirled around. She waved her left front<br>paw above her head and softly gave the<br>sailor\\'s cry: \\\"Hi ho!\\\"<br>Then she skipped gracefully and twirled<br>around on her right leg. And once again<br>she called, \\\"Hi ho! Hi ho!\\\".<br>\\\"That\\'s the way to dance the hornpipe,\\\"<br>Jenny thought.<br>She was surprised to find that she could<br>dance it very well, and she went on<br>practicing it behind the basket, out of sight.<br>When Pickles happened to look over to<br>make sure that Jenny was all right, Jenny<br>was now here to be seen. All that could be<br>seen was one black front paw appearing<br>from behind the basket and then<br>disappearing. In a second another front paw rose<br>and flapped and disappeared.<br>Pickles was terrified.<br>\\\"Jenny is drowning!\\\" he cried.<br>He left Alice Featherlegs and rushed off<br>to rescue Jenny. Florio ran after him. But<br>when they looked behind the basket, there<br>was no water. Jenny was not drowning.<br>Jenny was on dry ground - dancing the<br>sailor\\'s hornpipe!<br>\\\"Well, well,\\\" said Pickles with a note<br>of admiration in his queer, rough voice.<br>And Florio cried, \\\"Oh Jenny, will you<br>dance with me?\\\"<br>Pickles wanted to dance with Jenny, too.<br>So Jenny said she would dance with both<br>together, and they led her out into the<br>moonlit yard.<br>How proud she was to teach them<br>how to dance the sailor\\'s hornpipe!<br>The three friends were soon dancing so<br>beautifully that all the other cats rushed<br>over to them. All but Alice.<br>Alice was left alone in the middle of<br>the yard.<br>After a while she grew tired of being by<br>herself. She joined the others, and several<br>of her old friends taught her how to dance<br>the sailors hornpipe. But she could not<br>dance it half so well as Jenny.<br>Jenny led the dancers. Oh, what fun they<br>had! Their cries - \\\"Hi ho! Hi ho!\\\" - rose<br>high above the rooftops and drifted toward<br>the moon.<br>Jenny danced until the early hours of<br>the morning. Then her small black paws<br>grew weary.<br>Pickles said to Florio, \\\"It\\'s time to go.\\\"<br>The three cats thanked the others for<br>the lovely party.<br>Florio said to them, \\\"We\\'ll have to have<br>another party soon.\\\"<br>And Jenny said, \\\"I\\'ll give the party at<br>my house. All of you must come.\\\"<br>\\\"Hi ho! We\\'ll come!\\\" cried all the cats.<br>All but Alice Featherlegs.<br>Jenny looked at Alice.<br>\\\"Alice you must come, too,\\\" said Jenny.<br>\\\"My master, Captain Tinker, will be nice<br>to you.\\\"<br>Jenny, Florio and Pickles pattered down<br>the street toward home. At Jenny\\'s house<br>they sighed happily and parted.<br>Jenny crawled through the window that<br>her master, Captain Tinker, had left open<br>for her. She went upstairs and sleepily<br>rattled the doorknob of the Captain\\'s<br>bedroom door. The Captain heard her and<br>got out of bed and let her into the room.<br>He took her in his arms and stroked her<br>gently and untied her bright red scarf.<br>\\\"Oh, Captain, we went dancing,\\\" Jenny<br>murmured, \\\"and I could dance forever!\\\"<br>The Captain looked at her and smiled.<br>Jenny had fallen asleep.<br>WHEN JENNY LOST HER SCARF<br>O, happy<br>Are we<br>On our<br>Annual Spree.<br>- FROM AND OLD<br>MARCHING SONG<br>OF THE CAT CLUB<br>One fine spring day the little black cat,<br>Jenny Linsky, sat at the open window of<br>her house. Dreamily she watched her red<br>scarf drying on a clothesline in the garden.<br>\\\"I\\'m glad the housekeeper washed my<br>scarf,\\\" thought Jenny. \\\"Now it will be fresh<br>and clean for me to wear to the Annual<br>Spring Picnic of the Cat Club.\\\"<br>But all at once a rough dog, whom the<br>club had christened \\\"Rob the Robber,\\\"<br>rushed out of a cellar, grabbed Jenny\\'s scarf<br>and ran off with it. It happened so quickly<br>that Jenny didn\\'t have time to think or be<br>scared. All she wanted was to get her scarf<br>away from Rob. So she cut through the<br>garden, climbed over the tall board fence and<br>ran down the alley into South Street.<br>By sniffing the sidewalk, Jenny found the<br>trail of the dog and the scarf. She followed<br>the trail as far as the Toy and Catnip Shop<br>which stood<br>at the corner of the block.<br>Here Rob\\'s trail turned sharply around<br>the corner, into Mulligan Street.<br>\\\"I guess he\\'s taken my scarf to the Den<br>of the Dogs,\\\" thought Jenny with a shiver.<br>She crept close to the Toy and Catnip<br>Shop and peered cautiously down Mulligan<br>Street toward the dark cellar where Rob and<br>his band of dogs had their den. There was<br>not a dog in sight.<br>\\\"They\\'re probably all inside, pawing my<br>scarf,\\\" thought Jenny . \\\"But I\\'ll go into the<br>den and get my scarf, even if they chew<br>me up.\\\"<br>Fortunately, at this very moment, two<br>friendly voices called out, behind her,<br>\\\"Jenny! Jenny Linsky! Wait for us!\\\"<br>Jenny turned and saw the twin cats,<br>Romulus and Remus, standing on the curb across<br>the street. Of course she waited for them,<br>And when the traffic light turned from red<br>to green, the patchy-coated twins came<br>bounding over to her.<br>\\\"Jenny, what has happened?\\\" cried the<br>twins together. \\\"What are you doing out in<br>the street, without your scarf?\\\"<br>\\\"That Rob the Robber stole it,\\\" replied<br>Jenny indignantly . And she told them what<br>had happened.<br>The twins said, \\\"Well, Jenny, we admire<br>your spirit, but really you\\'re no match for<br>Rob. Why don\\'t you go home? We\\'ll try to<br>get your scarf and bring it to the Cat Club<br>tonight.\\\"<br>The twins pushed Jenny with their<br>speckled noses. She ran home and waited.<br>She waited all that afternoon; waited until<br>the sun dropped in the west; waited until<br>night descended and the cats began to gather<br>beneath the maple tree that stood in the far<br>corner of the Captain\\'s garden. When they<br>had formed a circle in front of their<br>President, Jenny crept over to them.<br>Romulus and Remus had saved a place for<br>her between them, and as she squeezed into<br>it they whispered to her, \\\"No luck. No luck.\\\"<br>\\\"Silence, please,\\\" ordered the President.<br>\\\"The meeting is about to open.\\\"<br>\\\"But this is important, Mr. President,\\\"<br>the twins objected. \\\"It\\'s about Jenny\\'s scarf.<br>It was stolen this morning.\\\"<br>Mr. President quickly opened the<br>meeting.<br>\\\"Jenny,\\\" he said gravely, \\\"will you please<br>step forward and tell us what happened?\\\"<br>Shyly the little black cat stepped into the<br>circle in front of Mr. President.<br>Jenny\\'s neck felt cold and bare without<br>her red wool scarf tied snugly around it.<br>And all those pairs of cat eyes staring at<br>her through the moonlight frightened her.<br>But she knew she had to speak. She must<br>make the Cat Club understand how<br>important was the scarf she had lost.<br>\\\"Mr. President,\\\" said Jenny, \\\"this<br>morning Rob the Robber stole the red wool scarf<br>my master, Captain Tinker, knit for me to<br>wear wherever I go. Captain Tinker has<br>gone off to sea on business. When he comes<br>home, I don\\'t want to have to tell him that I<br>lost my scarf. I\\'ll try my best to get it back.\\\"<br>\\\"Thank you, Jenny. You may be seated,\\\"<br>said Mr. President. \\\"Romulus and Remus,<br>kindly tell us what you know about this<br>robbery.\\\"<br>As Jenny sat down, the twins stepped<br>forward and explained how they had met Jenny<br>and why they had sent her home.<br>\\\"Then we followed Rob\\'s trail to the Den<br>of the Dogs on Mulligan Street,\\\" said the<br>twins. \\\"But Rob was guarding the door. He<br>shouted to us that Jenny\\'s scarf was hanging<br>on a nail in the den, and that a thousand<br>cats could never get it back because the den<br>would be guarded day and night.\\\"<br>\\\"Thank you Romulus and Remus,\\\" said<br>Mr. President. \\\"You may be seated, for I can<br>see that Madame Butterfly wishes to speak.\\\"<br>As the twins returned to their seats, the<br>club\\'s most beautiful member, the silvery<br>Madame Butterfly, stepped forward.<br>\\\"This robbery bristles my whiskers,\\\" she<br>declared. \\\"At noon, while I was out<br>shopping, I met Romulus and Remus. They told<br>me all about it. Of course, I feel that what<br>happened to Jenny this morning happened<br>because of what happened here last<br>Hallowe\\'en.\\\"<br>\\\"Excuse me, Madame Butterfly,\\\"<br>interrupted tough Sinbad. \\\"What has what<br>happened here last Hallowe\\'en got to do with<br>our Annual Spring Picnic? Tonight the<br>club\\'s supposed to al out our picnic<br>plans.\\\"<br>\\\"Patience, Sinbad,\\\" replied Butterfly. \\\"I<br>have a surprise for all of you. Look!\\\"<br>Slowly Butterfly opened her Silvery right<br>front paw. Between two of its velvety pads<br>lay a diamond, brighter than a star.<br>Jenny\\'s yellow eyes almost popped out of her<br>head, and cries of Oh! and Ah! and Please<br>may I touch it? went round the club.<br>Butterfly, guarding the diamond, said, \\\"I<br>have removed this jewel from the trimming<br>on my nose flute, and I\\'m giving it to the<br>club to pay for whatever it costs to get back<br>Jenny\\'s scarf. What\\'s left over shall be spent<br>on buying food for our picnic.\\\"<br>Sinbad asked, \\\"Do you<br>mean we can\\'t have our<br>picnic until we\\'ve found Jenny\\'s<br>scarf?\\\"<br>\\\"Exactly so,\\\" replied<br>Butterfly. \\\"Last Hallowe\\'en Jenny risked her<br>life to bring me my flute, which I had lost.<br>To do this, she had to outsmart Rob and all<br>his dogs. Today Rob got even with Jenny by<br>stealing her scarf. But I intend to help her<br>get it back with this diamond.\\\"<br>Mr. President took the diamond happily,<br>for there was not a penny in the treasury.<br>\\\"Mr. President,\\\" cried Sinbad, \\\"why not<br>buy Jenny a new scarf, instead of waiting<br>to get the old one back? Then we could<br>hold our picnic on Saturday night, as we\\'d<br>planned.\\\"<br>The members nodded. And Butterfly said,<br>\\\"Jenny, shall you and I go to the Toy and<br>Catnip Shop and try to buy a little scarf?\\\"<br>\\\"No,\\\" thought Jenny to herself. \\\"All the<br>diamonds in this city couldn\\'t buy me<br>anything as nice as my old red scarf. That was<br>the first scarf I ever had.\\\"<br>But Sinbad was saying, \\\"I know where we<br>can buy fine fishes for a picnic - cheap.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" sighed Jenny. \\\"The club does want<br>the picnic. Without the picnic, it won\\'t<br>seem to them like spring at all.\\\"<br>She raised her voice. \\\"Thank you,<br>Madame Butterfly. I\\'ll go shopping with you.\\\"<br>So Butterfly took back the diamond and<br>arranged to call for Jenny at<br>ten o\\'clock next morning. And<br>from breakfast until ten, Jenny<br>polished her fur and whiskers<br>for the shopping trip.<br>\\\"Jenny, how nice you look!\\\" said<br>Butterfly, when she arrived. \\\"Come, let\\'s start<br>before those dogs get wind of our plans.\\\"<br>Side by side, the two cats crossed the<br>garden, jumped over the fence, passed into<br>South Street and dashed to the Toy and<br>Catnip Shop. As they pushed open the door, the<br>owner looked at them with surprise.<br>\\\"My good woman,\\\" said Butterfly, \\\"have<br>you a red scarf or my young friend to<br>wear?\\\"<br>The woman did not seem to understand.<br>\\\"Maybe a pink scarf,\\\" suggested Butterfly.<br>Again the owner failed to understand.<br>\\\"Or a little blue scarf,\\\" said Butterfly,<br>flashing he diamond she carried in her paw.<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" exclaimed the woman. \\\"If you want<br>to buy a toy for her, she might enjoy this<br>duck.\\\" And she placed a big toy duck on the<br>floor in front of Jenny.<br>\\\"A duck to play with, when I need a scarf,\\\"<br>thought Jenny miserably. But to be polite,<br>she gave its tail a push.<br>\\\"Quack!\\\" shrieked the duck. \\\"Quack!<br>Quack!\\\"<br>\\\"Come Jenny,\\\" said Butterfly in disgust.<br>\\\"If this store doesn\\'t understand us, no store<br>will. We might as well go home.\\\"<br>That night, at the club, Butterfly had to<br>report that the shopping trip had failed. As<br>she returned the diamond to Mr . President,<br>she sad, \\\"There\\'s nothing left to do but<br>think of a way to get the old scarf back.\\\"<br>\\\"Yes,\\\" agreed Mr.President, \\\"let us close<br>our eyes and think.\\\"\\\"<br>So they all closed their eyes and thought,<br>but no one could think of a plan. When the<br>meeting finally broke up everyone felt blue.<br>Saturday night was drawing near, and it<br>looked as if there wouldn\\'t be picnic.<br>As Jenny paused in the window of her<br>house, on her way to bed, she murmured,<br>\\\"The club has done everything it can to help.<br>If we\\'re to have the picnic, I must get help<br>from somewhere else. But from whom?\\\"<br>Suddenly she remembered her friend, the<br>Fire Cat, Pickles, who worked in he Fire<br>House on South Street. Pickles had once told<br>her, \\\"If you ever need me, let me know.\\\"<br>Jenny knew it wouldn\\'t be much fun to<br>travel on the streets at night, without her<br>scarf to bring good luck. Perhaps those<br>dogs would catch her. Never mind. She\\'d<br>do the best she could. And without<br>thinking of her own safety, she ran to the fence,<br>jumped over it and sped down South Street<br>toward the Fire House. Fortunately she<br>reached it safely and found Pickles on duty.<br>\\\"Jenny, what\\'s the matter?\\\" he asked.<br>\\\"Rob the Robber stole my scarf,\\\"<br>explained Jenny. \\\"And he\\'s hung it in the Den<br>of the Dogs. The den is guarded so no cats<br>can get in. And one thing has led to another.<br>Now our club can\\'t have its Annual Spring<br>Picnic until we get back my scarf.\\\"<br>\\\"I wish I could help you,\\\" said Pickles.<br>\\\"Pickles,\\\" said Jenny, \\\"you\\'re a friend of<br>the Fire Dog, Buster. He\\'s a good dog, and<br>maybe you could ask him to tell Rob to give<br>me back my scarf.\\\"<br>\\\"Buster\\'s a very good dog,\\\" agreed<br>Pickles. \\\"But he works in a fire house way<br>uptown. I won\\'t see him until the Firemen\\'s<br>Ball in the summer. You run home, Jenny.<br>It\\'s long past your bedtime. I won\\'t forget<br>what you\\'ve told me. With dogs like those<br>Mulligan ruffians, anything might happen.\\\"<br>It happened that same night, while Jenny<br>was asleep in her basket in her upstairs<br>bedroom, next to the street. She had been<br>dreaming that the club was holding the picnic, and<br>she was with them, eating a delicious fish,<br>when she was awakened by the fire engines<br>roaring along South Street.<br>Sleepily she thought of Pickles on the<br>front seat of the hook and ladder - riding to<br>put out the fire. How safe she felt because<br>of Pickles! How proud she was to know<br>him! She was drifting back to sleep when<br>she heard a psst! psst! beneath her window.<br>Jenny ran to the<br>window and peered<br>into the street.<br>On the sidewalk stood Romulus and<br>Remus.<br>\\\"The Den of the Dogs is on fire!\\\" cried<br>the twins. \\\"Those dogs were playing with a<br>box of matches they stole this afternoon.<br>Jimminy whiskers! What a fire they started!<br>We\\'re going back to watch the blaze.\\\"<br>The twins dashed away and disappeared<br>around the corner of the street.<br>\\\"I must go, too,\\\"<br>thought Jenny. \\\"My<br>red scarf is in the den.<br>There \\'s no time to lose.<br>I\\'ll take the short cut<br>through the garden.\\\"<br>Jenny hurried down the stairs that led to<br>the garden window. As her black paws sped<br>from stair to stair, her mind kept saying,<br>\\\"My red scarf is in the den, and Pickles<br>has gone over there to fight the fire. Pickles<br>can save my scarf, but he\\'ll be too busy to<br>think of it himself. When I get there, I\\'ll<br>remind him.\\\"<br>Jenny leaped through the open window<br>and ran across the garden to the fence.<br>There she gathered her little black legs<br>together and made ready to jump to the top of<br>the fence. But when she tried to jump, her<br>hind legs seemed to stick to the ground.<br>She tried again, and again her hind legs<br>stuck to the ground.<br>She tried a third time, and for the third<br>time something seemed to hold her back.<br>It\\'s just as if I wasn\\'t meant to go to<br>the fire,\\\" she thought. \\\"But why shouldn\\'t<br>I go?\\\"<br>Suddenly the reason became as clear to<br>he the moonlight on the grass. Pickles\\'<br>duty was to fight the fire and keep it from<br>spreading.<br>\\\"I musn\\'t bother Pickles,\\\" Jenny decided.<br>\\\"I musn\\'t ask him to stop his noble work in<br>order to rescue my scarf. I musn\\'t even<br>go and watch the fire, because if Pickles<br>saw me he might remember my scarf and try<br>to save it, when he shouldn\\'t.\\\"<br>Jenny glanced around the garden. It was<br>utterly deserted.<br>\\\"I guess all the club has gone to the fire,\\\"<br>she thought. \\\"And I guess my scarf will<br>soon be burned to ashes. No scarf means<br>no Annual Spring Picnic. Oh! How the<br>club will hate me!\\\"<br>Jenny longed to run home, crawl into her<br>basket and hide her little black face.<br>\\\"But that would be cowardly,\\\" she<br>concluded. \\\"I\\'ll wait here at the fence. I\\'ll wait<br>and wait until someone from the club comes<br>home by way of the fence and will tell me<br>the news. Maybe Madame Butterfly will<br>come, and I could beg her please not to<br>think about a scarf for me, but to give all<br>the diamond to the picnic.\\\"<br>At last Jenny could hear the hook and<br>ladder returning slowly down South Street.<br>The bell of the hook and ladder was ringing,<br>\\\"Fire\\'s out! Fire\\'s out!\\\" And after a while<br>she heard four paws turn into the alley.<br>\\\"That\\'s no one from the club,\\\" she thought.<br>\\\"I know the sound of all their paws.\\\"<br>Pit-pat! Pit-pat! The sound drew nearer<br>and nearer. It was like the fire bell, saying<br>\\\"Fire\\'s out! Fire\\'s out!\\\"<br>Jenny heard someone jump, and saw a<br>huge spotted yellow paw clutch the top of<br>the fence. Above the paw rose a shiny black<br>helmet and a yellow face. Then came the<br>left front paw, clutching something red.<br>\\\"Catch!\\\" boomed the Fire Cat.<br>Jenny reached up and caught the scarf. It<br>hadn\\'t been burned at all.<br>\\\"Oh, thank you, Pickles! Thanks a<br>thousand million times. Was anybody hurt?\\\"<br>\\\"Nobody hurt,\\\" replied Pickles. \\\"But the<br>den is flooded with water from the hose. I<br>guess those dogs have learned a lesson.\\\"<br>\\\"Pickles,\\\" said Jenny shyly, \\\"with all you<br>had to do, how did you remember my scarf?\\\"<br>The Fire Cat laughed.\\\"<br>\\\"At first I didn\\'t have time to think of<br>anything but helping the firemen squirt the<br>hose,\\\" he said. \\\"Then the Chief told me to<br>rest. So I stopped and looked at the crowd.<br>All the Cat Club was there - all but you.\\\"<br>\\\"What did you think when you didn\\'t see<br>me?\\\" asked Jenny.<br>\\\"I thought of your scarf,\\\" answered<br>Pickles.<br>\\\"Oh, Pickles! I wish I could have helped<br>you rescue it!\\\" cried Jenny.<br>\\\"You helped me best by staying home,\\\"<br>said Pickles. \\\"It takes courage for a little cat<br>to wait patiently and unselfishly at home<br>when her best red scarf is in a fire.\\\"<br>The Fire Cat raised his yellow paw,<br>touched his helmet and saluted Jenny.<br>At that same moment, something moved<br>toward her through the bushes. When she<br>turned, Mr. President was standing on the<br>moonlit grass, with all the members of the<br>Cat Club.<br>\\\"Jenny,\\\" began Mr. President, \\\"our club<br>is proud to see you honored by the Fire<br>Department for your patience and<br>unselfishness.\\\"<br>\\\"Aye! Aye!\\\" sang the members.<br>\\\"We of the Cat Club also wish to honor<br>you,\\\" said Mr. President. \\\"We wish to honor<br>you for this reason. Although you\\'re small<br>and shy, you always do the best you can.\\\"<br>Jenny\\'s hear felt warm and happy.<br>\\\"Jenny,\\\" continued Mr. President, \\\"our<br>club shall hold its Annual Spring Picnic on<br>Saturday night in Washington Park, three<br>blocks north of our garden. You, Jenny<br>Linsky, wearing your red scarf, shall lead us as<br>we march through the Arch of Victory that<br>guards the entrance into the picnic grounds.\\\"<br>JENNY\\'S ADOPTED BROTHERS<br>THE little black cat, Jenny Linsky, sat<br>down beside the rosebush in her master\\'s<br>garden. The roses were in bloom, the birds<br>were singing and the sun shone brightly.<br>\\\"How lucky I am to have this garden and<br>a master like the Captain,\\\" thought Jenny.<br>\\\"I wish every cat could have the nice things<br>I have.\\\"<br>At that moment Jenny was surprised to<br>see a black and white cat sitting alone in a<br>corner of the garden.<br>\\\"There\\'s a cat I\\'ve never seen before,\\\"<br>continued Jenny. \\\"He looks as if he wanted<br>something. He\\'s bigger than I, but maybe I<br>can help him.\\\"<br>Jenny straightened the red scarf she was<br>wearing, and ran over to the stranger.<br>\\\"Hello,\\\" she said. \\\"My name is Jenny<br>Linsky. What\\'s yours?\\\"<br>The stranger removed a red ball he was<br>holding in his mouth, and said, \\\"My name is<br>Checkers.\\\"<br>\\\"Checkers what?\\\" asked Jenny.<br>\\\"I can\\'t remember my last name,\\\" said<br>Checkers. \\\"So much has happened that I\\'ve<br>forgotten lots of things.\\\"<br>\\\"Checkers is a very pretty name,\\\" said<br>Jenny in a comforting voice. \\\"And it\\'s a<br>good name for you,\\\" she added as she<br>examined the furry, black checks on his thin,<br>white legs. \\\"But you look hungry. Don\\'t<br>they feed you at home?\\\"<br>\\\"I haven\\'t any home,\\\" said Checkers.<br>\\\"No home?\\\" cried Jenny. \\\"Oh, it isn\\'t<br>fair! Why, Checkers, I have this lovely<br>garden and that brick house with the ivy on it.<br>And my master, Captain Tinker, is the nicest<br>master in the world.\\\"<br>As she gazed at Checkers\\' darling, heart-<br>shaped face, she had a bright idea.<br>\\\"Checkers,\\\" she said ,\\\"I\\'m Captain<br>Tinker\\'s only cat. If you\\'ll come home with me.<br>I\\'ll ask the Captain to adopt you.\\\"<br>\\\"Thank you,\\\" cried Checkers joyfully.<br>\\\"I\\'ll go with you as soon as Edward comes.\\\"<br>\\\"Edward? Who is he?\\\" asked Jenny.<br>\\\"Edward is my big brother,\\\" replied<br>Checkers. \\\"His last name is Brandywine.<br>We met when both of us lost our homes, and<br>we\\'ve been brothers ever since. Where I go,<br>Edward goes too.\\\"<br>\\\"Checkers,\\\" sighed Jenny, \\\"maybe my<br>master isn\\'t rich enough to adopt two-\\\"<br>Jenny didn\\'t have time to finish her<br>sentence. Edward had heard his name, and he<br>came hurrying out of the bushes.<br>He was a tiger cat with broad, white<br>chest and beautiful eyes. But in those eyes<br>there was the sad look of cats who have no<br>homes.<br>\\\"Edward,\\\" said Checkers this is Jenny<br>Linsky. She\\'s going to ask her master,<br>Captain Tinker, to adopt us.\\\"<br>Just then a bell rang in the garden.<br>\\\"That\\'s the Captain calling me to lunch,\\\"<br>explained Jenny.<br>Checkers picked up his red ball and<br>started toward the Captain\\'s house.<br>But Jenny said, \\\"Wait. Isn\\'t easy to<br>get two cats adopted. We must work out a plan.\\\"<br>She thought hard for a moment and then<br>said, \\\"I have it. I\\'ll try to get you adopted<br>one at a time.\\\"<br>\\\"Jenny,\\\" begged Edward, \\\"please try to<br>get Checkers adopted first. He\\'s smaller<br>than I, and very hungry. I\\'ll wait outside<br>your house until you call me. If you don\\'t<br>call me, I \\'11 know the Captain hasn\\'t enough<br>room for me.\\\"<br>\\\"Edward!\\\" cried Checkers. \\\"Didn\\'t you<br>and I promise to stick together?\\\"<br>Edward gazed up toward the point where<br>the tall buildings of the city scraped the sky.<br>His right nostril twitched. \\\"I smell a storm,\\\"<br>he murmured. \\\"By night we shall have rain.\\\"<br>Then he looked tenderly at Checkers and<br>said, \\\"Another night outdoors in the cold<br>rain might make you sick. Please go with<br>Jenny into Captain Tinker\\'s house. Show<br>him the retrieving trick I taught you. I\\'m<br>sure he\\'ll adopt you when he see how nicely<br>you retrieve.\\\"<br>\\\"Retrieve? What\\'s that?\\\" asked Jenny.<br>\\\"To retrieve means to run after something<br>and bring it back,\\\" explained Checkers.<br>\\\"This red ball I carry everywhere is my<br>retrieving ball.\\\"<br>At that moment the lunch bell sounded<br>for the second time.<br>\\\"We mustn\\'t keep the Captain waiting,\\\"<br>said Jenny. \\\"Checkers, when we get home,<br>you must retrieve for us.\\\"<br>The three cats ran toward Captain<br>Tinker\\'s house. On the way Jenny asked Edward,<br>\\\"Can you retrieve too?\\\"<br>\\\"No,\\\" he answered. \\\"There\\'s no trick I<br>can do. But some day, if I find a home that<br>has a little office in it, I should like to write.\\\"<br>\\\"Write what?\\\" asked Jenny.<br>\\\"Write about the troubles I\\'ve had,\\\"<br>replied Edward.<br>When the cats reached the house, Edward<br>crawled into the bushes near the open<br>window, and Jenny led Checkers through the<br>window, into the living room.<br>Captain Tinker who was an old sailor,<br>was sitting in his armchair, waiting for<br>Jenny.<br>He must have been surprised to see her<br>bringing home a black and white cat, with<br>a heart-shaped face, who held a red ball in<br>his mouth.<br>But the Captain was polite to cats. He let<br>Jenny speak first.<br>She whispered to Checkers, \\\"Retrieve.\\\"<br>Checkers passed h all to Jenny. \\\"Hit it<br>hard,\\\" he said.<br>She batted it across the<br>floor. He bounded after it,<br>caught with his teeth,<br>returned with it and laid<br>it at the Captain\\'s<br>feet.<br>The Captain said to Checkers, \\\"That was<br>the most beautiful retiring I\\'ve ever seen.<br>And such a pretty ball!\\\"<br>Checkers whispered to Jenny, \\\"Hit the<br>ball again. I must retrieve some more to<br>help get Edward adopted.\\\"<br>But Captain Tinker picked up the ball,<br>and looking thoughtfully at Checkers, said,<br>\\\"You\\'re hungry, and a red ball never filled<br>an empty stomach. You must stay and eat<br>some lunch with Jenny. After that - why,<br>after that, you may live with us forever, if<br>you wish.\\\"<br>\\\"Checkers,\\\" cried Jenny happily, \\\"you\\'ve<br>been adopted. Now I\\'ll call Edward.\\\"<br>She turned toward the window. To her<br>surprise she saw that Edward had come to<br>the window sill without waiting to be called.<br>On his striped face there was a look that<br>Jenny had never seen on any cat. It was the<br>look of a cat gazing at something warm and<br>beautiful which he may have to leave because<br>he is not wanted.<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" thought Jenny. \\\"The Captain<br>mustn\\'t send Edward away; it would break<br>his heart. I must speak to the Captain about<br>this and try to make him understand.\\\"<br>Jenny was on the point of jumping onto<br>her master\\'s knees to plead for Edward,<br>when the Captain caught sight of the face<br>at the window. And he saw Checkers glance<br>quickly at the face. Then Checkers sat very<br>straight and still, like someone wishing hard<br>for something to come true.<br>\\\"These two cats belong together,\\\"<br>murmured Captain Tinker.<br>Without another word he walked to the<br>window and pulled Edward gently into the<br>room. In that way Edward was adopted.<br>Afterward the Captain took<br>off Jenny\\'s scarf and hung it<br>on its hook. He put Checkers\\'<br>red ball in a glass bowl on the<br>shelf above the scarf.<br>Then the Captain said to Edward, \\\"You<br>haven\\'t a red ball and you haven\\'t a red scarf<br>But you shall soon have something red, so<br>that everyone will know you are one of us.<br>After lunch I\\'ll make you a red leather<br>collar.\\\"<br>\\\"My!\\\" thought Jenny. \\\"How quickly<br>things have happened. My brothers came.<br>They were adopted. What will happen<br>next?\\\"<br>Jenny and her brothers followed Captain<br>Tinker into the kitchen. There he put two<br>extra plates on Jenny\\'s feeding tray, and<br>filled all three of the plates with carrots<br>and beef.<br>The brothers could not believe their eyes.<br>It was so long since they had seen a meal like<br>this. They tried to purr their thanks to<br>Captain Tinker. But their purrs got mixed with<br>their food.<br>Each mouthful that the brothers ate put<br>new life into their tired bodies. When lunch<br>was over and they had washed their faces,<br>Checkers and Edward looked like happy<br>cats. Jenny no longer felt sorry for them.<br>Edward turned to her and asked politely,<br>\\\"Do you think the Captain has a little office<br>where I might do some writing?\\\"<br>\\\"Captain Tinker has gone down to his<br>workshop in the cellar,\\\" replied Jenny. \\\"I\\'ll<br>take you through our house. I\\'m sure you\\'ll<br>find an office somewhere.\\\"<br>Jenny led Edward and Checkers up the<br>stairs. At the top of the stairs she said<br>proudly, \\\"Our house has three floors. This<br>is the second floor, and - \\\"<br>Suddenly Jenny remembered the day when<br>she herself was adopted by Captain Tinker.<br>The Captain, after rescuing her from trouble<br>in the street, had brought her into this same<br>house and allowed her to explore it by<br>herself, the way cats like to do.<br>So Jenny told her brothers, \\\"You may<br>explore this second floor. I\\'ll wait for you<br>downstairs.\\\"<br>Jenny returned to the living room and<br>waited on the sofa. While she waited, she<br>could hear the brothers exploring overhead,<br>from room to room. With each step and sniff<br>they made, she felt that Checkers and<br>Edward were becoming more and more a part<br>of this dear home where she had always been<br>the only cat.<br>Soon Checkers came pattering down the<br>stairs.<br>\\\"Edward has found an office,.\\\" he<br>announced to Jenny. \\\"It\\'s in a closet, behind<br>the Captain\\'s rubber boots.<br>Behind the<br>Captain\\'s rubber boots!<br>Jenny gulped .... That was a place<br>where she liked to<br>doze on rainy days.<br>And it was raining<br>now.<br>The storm which Edward predicted had<br>burst on the garden.<br>\\\"How dark the garden looks!\\\" exclaimed<br>Checkers. \\\"It\\'s as black as night. I guess I\\'ll<br>take a nap.\\\"<br>Without asking Jenny\\'s permission, he<br>climbed into the Captain\\'s armchair and fell<br>asleep.<br>Jenny wished that Checkers had chosen<br>another place for his nap.<br>\\\"I know he\\'s tired,\\\" she thought crossly.<br>\\\"But I\\'m the only cat who has ever slept in<br>Captain Tinker\\'s armchair.\\\"<br>Then she wondered what Edward was<br>doing: \\\"I bet he isn\\'t writing at all. I bet he\\'s<br>snoozing.\\\"<br>Jenny tiptoed up the stairs. As she passed<br>Edward\\'s office in the closet, she could hear<br>the sound of heavy breathing mingled with<br>delicate snores.<br>\\\"Just what I thought,\\\" she told herself.<br>\\\"Well, if everyone else can take a nap, I have<br>a right to take one too. Maybe I\\'ll feel better<br>after it.\\\"<br>Jenny went into the Captain\\'s bedroom,<br>crawled into her basket and fell sound asleep.<br>When she awakened at supper time, she felt<br>rested and cheerful.<br>\\\"From now on I\\'ll share everything with<br>Checkers and Edward,\\\" she decided as she<br>went down the stairs.<br>But when she entered the living room, her<br>heart turned cold with jealousy.<br>Captain Tinker was sitting in his<br>armchair. On one of his knees sat Checkers. On<br>the other knee sat Edward wearing a new,<br>red leather collar!<br>Jenny rushed toward her brothers.<br>\\\"The Captain\\'s knees belong to me,\\\" she<br>cried. \\\"Get down!\\\"<br>Checkers and Edward jumped quickly to<br>the floor. Then the Captain picked up Jenny,<br>stroked her cheek and said, \\\"Jenny, don\\'t be<br>jealous of your brothers. I love you just as<br>much as ever.\\\"<br>But Jenny was too upset to believe him.<br>Before she knew what she was doing she had<br>scratched the Captain\\'s hand. Then,<br>frightened by her awful deed, she fled to a safe<br>place beneath the sofa.<br>Captain Tinker did not call after her or<br>scold her. Instead, he walked quietly into the<br>kitchen and washed the scratch. Next, he<br>opened the door of the icebox. Jenny could<br>hear him take out the supper food, warm it<br>and fill the three plates on her tray. After<br>that, he returned to his workshop in the<br>cellar.<br>\\\"I know why the Captain has left me,\\\"<br>thought Jenny. \\\"He wants me to make<br>friends with my brothers. But I won\\'t do it.<br>Maybe I shall never speak to them again.<br>Anyway, I\\'ll let them eat their supper by<br>themselves.\\\"<br>She listened, but could not hear Checkers<br>and Edward go into the kitchen. She could<br>not hear them in the living room. Fear<br>gripped her heart. Perhaps she\\'d been so<br>horrid that her brothers had run off to find<br>another home.<br>Jenny rushed into the kitchen. The<br>brothers were not there, and they had not touched<br>their supper.<br>She rushed upstairs and could not find<br>them anywhere.<br>She ran downstairs and jumped onto the<br>shelf.<br>Checkers\\' red retrieving ball was gone!<br>\\\"That\\'s it,\\\" she moaned. \\\"He\\'s taken his<br>ball and run off with Edward. And on a night<br>like this! Why, they may die of cold and<br>hunger. I\\'ll go after them, and I won\\'t come<br>home until I\\'ve found them.\\\"<br>Jenny dashed out into the rain. She<br>splashed across the garden, climbed over<br>the fence and ran down the alley into South<br>Street. There she could not tell which way to<br>turn. The rain had washed away all traces of<br>her brothers\\' paws.<br>She decided to turn to the right, and ran<br>through swirling puddles, while the rain<br>drenched her back and filled her ears. On<br>and on she ran, looking in every doorway.<br>But she could not find her brothers.<br>At last she felt that she was running the<br>wrong way. She stopped and asked herself,<br>\\\"Where would I go on a rainy night, if I<br>were homeless? I\\'d go to the fish shop, and<br>wait in the doorway, and hope that in the<br>morning someone would give me some fish<br>for breakfast.\\\"<br>Jenny turned back on her trail, and<br>worked her way through the soaking rain<br>until she reached the fish shop. There,<br>huddled in the doorway, sat her brothers.<br>\\\"Checkers! Edward!\\\" she cried. \\\"I\\'ve<br>been mean and selfish. Please forgive me and<br>come home.\\\"<br>\\\"Jenny,\\\" said Edward gravely, \\\"Checkers<br>and I must try to find another home. We don\\'t<br>feel you want us in your house.\\\"<br>\\\"I do want you,\\\" she protested.<br>\\\"Do you love us?\\\" asked Checkers.<br>\\\"With all my heart,\\\" she cried. \\\"To prove<br>how much I love you, I\\'ll let you and Edward<br>sleep every night in my own basket in the<br>Captain\\'s bedroom. I\\'ll sleep in the cellar.\\\"<br>\\\"Jenny, that proves you really love us,\\\"<br>declared Edward. \\\"We\\'ll go home with you.<br>But we won\\'t take your basket. We\\'ll sleep in<br>the cellar.\\\"<br>\\\"No, I\\'ll sleep in the cellar,\\\" Jenny said.<br>\\\"No, we will,\\\" said the brothers.<br>\\\"I will,\\\" insisted Jenny. Then she added<br>quickly, \\\"Let\\'s not argue now, for we should<br>hurry home. I want to find the Captain and<br>beg him to forgive me for scratching his<br>hand.\\\"<br>Jenny and her brothers ran home through<br>the rain. When they reached the house they<br>found the Captain waiting anxiously for<br>them, with bath towels to rub them dry.<br>As he rubbed Jenny\\'s fur she tucked her<br>chin in the hand she had scratched, and<br>begged him to forgive her.<br>\\\"Oh, that was just a little scratch,\\\" said<br>Captain Tinker. \\\"You made up for it when<br>you ran out into the rainy night to find your<br>brothers.\\\"<br>Then Jenny tried to tell the Captain about<br>the sleeping basket. But he said briskly, \\\"Go<br>now and eat your supper.\\\"<br>So she went into the kitchen with Checkers<br>and Edward, and ate supper.<br>After that, the Captain said to her, \\\"It\\'s<br>very late, and time for all good cats to be in<br>bed. Come, see what I have built for your<br>two brothers.\\\"<br>Jenny and her brothers followed Captain<br>Tinker up the stairs. In the room next to his<br>bedroom stood two little bunks that he had<br>built one above the other. Each bunk had a<br>warm red blanket on it.<br>\\\"Now no one will have to sleep in the<br>cellar,\\\" cried Jenny happily, while her brothers<br>rubbed their backs against the Captain\\'s legs<br>and thanked him.<br>Checkers chose the upper bunk, Edward<br>climbed into the lower one, and everybody<br>said good night .<br>Jenny crawled into her basket in the next<br>room, and the Captain went downstairs to<br>smoke his pipe. Outside, the rain beat at the<br>window panes.<br>\\\"It\\'s good to be indoors on such a night,\\\"<br>thought Jenny, with a yawn.<br>She closed her eyes but could not go to<br>sleep, for she kept worrying about her<br>brothers. It would be terrible if they had run away<br>again.<br>After a time Jenny crept into her brothers\\'<br>room. She found that Checkers had come<br>into the lower bunk and cuddled in Edward\\'s<br>arms.<br>How peacefully the brothers slept! The<br>longer Jenny watched them, the happier she<br>felt. She also felt that someone should be<br>thanked for all this happiness. So she went<br>downstairs and said good night again to<br>Captain Tinker.<br>HOW THE BROTHERS JOINED THE CAT CLUB<br>FOR TWO NIGHTS AND DAYS it<br>had rained on Captain Tinker\\'s garden, and<br>the cats who lived around the garden had to<br>stay indoors.<br>From time to time they pulled aside the<br>curtains at their windows and stared at the<br>Captain\\'s house. They all felt something<br>strange had happened there. Just what it<br>was, they did not know.<br>Inside the Captain\\'s house, the little black<br>cat, Jenny Linsky, looked out on the rainy<br>garden and thought gloomily, \\\"Things<br>might be easier if it rained forever. Then I<br>wouldn\\'t have to decide what to do about the<br>Cat Club meeting.\\\"<br>Jenny\\'s two new brothers, Checkers and<br>Edward, came downstairs to play with her.<br>\\\"Keep away from the window,\\\" she cried<br>quickly. \\\"All the other cats are looking at<br>our house.\\\"<br>\\\"Jenny, what\\'s the matter?\\\" asked the<br>younger brother, Checkers. \\\"Why don\\'t you<br>want the other cats to know you rescued<br>Edward and me from the rain? Why don\\'t you<br>want your friends to know that Captain<br>Tinker has adopted us? Don\\'t you love us<br>any more?\\\"<br>\\\"You\\'re the nicest brothers anyone ever<br>had,\\\" replied Jenny. \\\"Everything I have<br>inside this house is yours as much as mine. But<br>after the rain stops, something special is<br>going to happen in the garden. It\\'s<br>something I must decide about.\\\"<br>Jenny sounded so unhappy that Edward,<br>the older brother, said, \\\"Come on, Checkers.<br>It\\'s time for you and me to go upstairs again.<br>I have to continue my writing, and you<br>should practice retrieving your red ball.\\\"<br>Checkers jumped onto the shelf and took<br>his red retrieving ball from the glass bowl<br>where he kept it. He grasped the ball<br>between his teeth and followed Edward up the<br>stairs.<br>Jenny looked out again on the rainy<br>garden. The rain was stopping.<br>\\\"Tonight the moon will come up,\\\" she<br>thought. \\\"And the Cat Club will meet<br>beneath the maple tree. But I can\\'t - I really<br>can\\'t tell my brothers about it. I\\'ll steal out<br>and go to the meeting all alone.\\\"<br>As Jenny was usually very generous, she<br>felt sorry about not taking her brothers to the<br>meeting.<br>\\\"Why is it,\\\" she wondered, \\\"that I don\\'t<br>want Checkers and Edward to belong to the<br>Cat Club? They\\'re part of my family now,<br>and I should share my good times with them.<br>But at the Cat Club I can be different than<br>I am at home, just because my family isn\\'t<br>around. No one here at home - not even<br>Captain Tinker - would ever guess the<br>things I\\'ve done at the Club.\\\"<br>Jenny had done many good deeds at the<br>Club, and some of them had required<br>courage. She remembered the night when she had<br>braved a gang of wicked dogs in order to<br>carry a flute to a sick member of the Club.<br>Another night Jenny a led the entire<br>Cat Club in its parade to the park for the<br>Annual Spring Picnic.<br>THE DUKE<br>SINBAD<br>ROMULUS<br>REMUS<br>JUNIOR<br>SOLOMON<br>ARABELLA & ANTONIO<br>MACARONI<br>CONCERTINA<br>MADAME BUTTERFLY<br>MR. PRESIDENT<br>This chart shows the order in which the members of the<br>Cat Club marched behind Jenny in the Picnic Parade.<br>The more Jenny thought about it, the more<br>amazed she grew that she, who was so small<br>and shy and black, had been able to do such<br>glorious deeds. \\\"And I\\'ve done them, all<br>alone, with no one to help me,\\\" she said to<br>herself, rather proudly.<br>A that moment Jenny\\'s master, the old<br>sea captain, Captain Tinker, came into the<br>room. He held in his hand the bright red<br>scarf had knit for Jenny long ago. One of<br>the tassels had come loose, and he had just<br>sewn it on.<br>The Captain was about to hang the scarf<br>on its hook when he caught Jenny\\'s eye.<br>Suddenly she realized that what she had been<br>thinking wasn\\'t quite true. She hadn\\'t done<br>her brave deeds, all alone.<br>And she thought to herself, \\\"Without that<br>scarf to protect me, I wouldn\\'t have even<br>dared to join the Cat Club. Captain Tinker<br>helped me when he gave me the scarf, and<br>I should help my brothers so they can get<br>their share of fun. But it won\\'t be easy.\\\"<br>Jenny looked at Captain Tinker, and he<br>could tell from her worried yellow eyes that<br>she had something difficult to do.<br>He tied the scarf around her neck and said<br>gently, \\\"Brave deeds can be done at home<br>as well as in the world outside.\\\"<br>Then he returned to his workshop in the<br>cellar.<br>Jenny tucked her chin in the scarf, and the<br>scarf gave her courage.<br>\\\"I\\'ll take my brothers with me to the Cat<br>Club,\\\" she decided. \\\"Even if it spoils a little<br>of my fun, I\\'ll do it.\\\"<br>Now that she\\'d made up her mind, Jenny<br>felt much better.<br>She went upstairs to find her brothers.<br>Jenny found Checkers practicing his<br>retrieving in the hall. Retrieving his little<br>red ball was a trick Edward had taught<br>him while they were wandering homeless<br>through the wide, wide world, before they<br>came to live with Jenny.<br>Checkers had chosen one corner of the<br>hall for his home base. He would stand on<br>the home base, bat the ball down the hall<br>with his paw, chase the ball, pick it up with<br>his teeth and carry it back to the base.<br>Chasing the ball and bringing it back was called<br>\\\"retrieving.\\\"<br>Jenny loved to watch her black and white<br>brother retrieve, but right now she had other<br>things to do.<br>\\\"Checkers,\\\" she said, \\\"I\\'m sorry I was<br>cross with you downstairs. I was busy<br>making up my mind about our Cat Club. Most<br>all the cats who live near here belong to it.<br>We\\'ll meet tonight, and you and Edward<br>must go with me to the meeting. I\\'ll ask if<br>you may join the Club.\\\"<br>\\\"Is it hard to join?\\\" asked Checkers.<br>\\\"Quite hard,\\\" admitted Jenny. \\\"No one is<br>allowed to become a member unless he can<br>do a special trick. You\\'ll get in all right<br>because of your retrieving trick.\\\"<br>\\\"And Edward\\'s trick can be his writing,\\\"<br>said Checkers.<br>\\\"Yes,\\\" agreed Jenny, \\\"writing will be<br>Edward\\'s special trick.\\\"<br>But suddenly an awful thought occurred<br>to her: what if Edward couldn\\'t write?<br>It was true he\\'d found an office for<br>himself in a corner of the closet, behind Captain<br>Tinker\\'s rubber boots. Edward had spent<br>many hours in his new office. But maybe he<br>had only been sleeping there. So far he hadn\\'t<br>shown Jenny anything he\\'d written.<br>\\\"Checkers,\\\" she said, \\\"I\\'m afraid we\\'d<br>better speak to Edward.\\\"<br>The two cats poked their noses into the<br>closet where their older brother (a gentle cat<br>with handsome tiger stripes) was lying<br>comfortably behind the Captain\\'s boots.<br>\\\"Edward,\\\" said Jenny, \\\"excuse us for<br>bothering you. I\\'m sure you\\'re very busy.<br>But there\\'s something you should know.\\\"<br>Edward looked up from the floor.<br>\\\"It\\'s about our Cat Club,\\\" continued<br>Jenny. \\\"We meet whenever there\\'s a moon,<br>and there will be a moon tonight.\\\"<br>Edward\\'s soft eyes brightened.<br>\\\"We have a President, a<br>Secretary and eleven<br>regular members,\\\" explained<br>Jenny. \\\"Our motto is<br>Loyalty, Fidelity, Truth and<br>Dues. I hope you and Checkers will be<br>allowed to join the Club.\\\"<br>\\\"Thank you,\\\" said Edward. \\\"It sounds<br>very exciting.\\\"<br>\\\"But you must be able to do a special<br>trick,\\\" continued Jenny. \\\"Checkers, of<br>course, can retrieve. When I joined the<br>Club, Captain Tinker made me some ice<br>skates and I skated. If it were winter now,<br>instead of spring, I\\'d lend my skates to you.\\\"<br>\\\"Skating is your trick, not mine,\\\" said<br>Edward. \\\"Mine must be my writing.\\\"<br>Jenny said, \\\"Would you have a piece of<br>writing you could read to us, just to see if<br>it\\'s the kind of thing the Cat Club likes?\\\"<br>\\\"I haven\\'t had time to do any real<br>writing,\\\" admitted Edward. \\\"But I\\'ve been<br>thinking about a poem I\\'d like to write some<br>day. It would begin like this:<br>\\\"I\\'d love to be a butterfly<br>Flying high -flying high.\\\"<br>Edward stopped and looked up hopefully.<br>\\\"What do you think?\\\" he asked.<br>Jenny thought to herself, \\\"I think it\\'s<br>awful. But I can\\'t tell him so. I\\'d hurt his<br>feelings.\\\"<br>\\\"Please tell me the truth,\\\" he begged.<br>Poor Jenny said nothing. The truth was<br>too hard for her to tell.<br>But the word \\\"truth\\\" kept running<br>through her mind. Where had she heard the<br>word before? Loyalty, Fidelity, Truth and<br>Dues. It was the third word in the Cat Club<br>motto.<br>So she decided to tell Edward the truth.<br>And she realized it would be better for him<br>to learn it now, when it might help him. She<br>would try to tell it nicely, so he wouldn\\'t feel<br>too hurt.<br>\\\"Edward,\\\" she said bravely, \\\"the Cat Club<br>is tough. Most of the members are older than<br>you, and they might think your poem is<br>babyish. You should give them something<br>scary. Something that will make their fur<br>stand up. Something that will make their<br>whiskers twitch - and shiver.\\\"<br>\\\"Shiver their whiskers,\\\" murmured<br>Edward. \\\"H\\'m. I know the poem to write.\\\"<br>A faraway look crept into Edward\\'s face.<br>He hunched his shoulders, and the claws of<br>his right paw scratched the floor. Edward<br>was writing!<br>Jenny went downstairs with Checkers and<br>they jumped onto the sofa.<br>\\\"Jenny,\\\" said Checkers, \\\"you must be<br>tired after all you\\'ve done. Let\\'s take naps<br>and get rested for the meeting.\\\"<br>They snuggled together, and while they<br>slept, Jenny had a terrible dream about<br>Edward\\'s not being allowed to join the Cat<br>Club. She waked up with a start and found<br>the sun was shining brightly.<br>Checkers waked, too, and went upstairs.<br>He came down immediately and said,<br>\\\"Edward is still writing. He\\'ll see us at supper.\\\"<br>When Edward heard Captain Tinker<br>rattling the supper dishes, he came downstairs.<br>\\\"Did you write a scary poem?\\\" asked<br>Jenny.<br>\\\"Shiver my whiskers! I did,\\\" he declared.<br>\\\"But it would be bad luck for me to tell you<br>what it is before the Club meeting.\\\"<br>After supper the three cats got ready for<br>the meeting. With licks of their pink tongues,<br>they washed their furry coats and smoothed<br>their whiskers.<br>When the moon shone on the garden,<br>things began to happen. Bushes stirred,<br>shadows moved across the grass. Jenny<br>stood watching at the window, while her<br>brothers sat near her on the floor.<br>\\\"I\\'ll keep you a secret till the meeting gets<br>started,\\\" she said. \\\"Rough cats like Sinbad<br>and The Duke can think up lots of trouble<br>THE DUKE<br>SINBAD<br>if they have too much time for thinking.<br>Those two are coming now.\\\"<br>Other cats were also rushing to the<br>meeting. Jenny named them: the twins, Romulus<br>and Remus; Solomon, the wizened wise cat<br>who accompanied the President\\'s young<br>nephew, Junior; the sweethearts, Arabella<br>and Antonio; the fancy dancer, Macaroni;<br>and the fluffy Madame Butterfly, who could<br>play sweet music; on a nose flute.<br>\\\"There goes our Secretary, Concertina,\\\"<br>whispered Jenny. \\\"She\\'s climbing up the<br>maple tree, where she scratches records of<br>our meetings. Everybody\\'s there except Mr.<br>President. Oh! He\\'s coming now. Let\\'s start.<br>Checkers, have you your retrieving ball?<br>And don\\'t forget you\\'re to wait with Edward<br>in the bushes till I call you.\\\"<br>Jenny gave one last anxious look at<br>Edward, who was nervously muttering his<br>poem. Then she jumped into the garden. Her<br>brothers followed, and while they crawled<br>into the bushes, Jenny sped to the meeting.<br>She arrived just as it opened.<br>\\\"Does anyone have any special business<br>to discuss?\\\" asked Mr. President.<br>Jenny waved a small black paw.<br>He said, \\\"Jenny, name your business.\\\"<br>Her heart thumped as she began: \\\"Mr.<br>President, I have two wonderful new<br>brothers. Their names are Checkers and Edward.\\\"<br>All eyes stared at Jenny. So that was what<br>had been happening in her house. New<br>brothers. Two of them!<br>\\\"Please, Mr. President,\\\" she continued.<br>\\\"May my brothers join this noble Cat Club?<br>They\\'re waiting in the bushes.\\\"<br>\\\"Bring forth the brothers,\\\" ordered Mr.<br>President.<br>Jenny ran to the bushes and returned with<br>her brother. The members gave Checkers<br>a friendly nod, because his red retrieving<br>ball looked so exciting. But Edward seemed<br>like such a gentlemanly cat that Sinbad and<br>The Duke began to giggle.<br>\\\"Silence,\\\" commanded Mr. President.<br>\\\"Checkers and Edward shall be discussed in<br>alphabetical order. C. comes before E. Will<br>C. step forward?\\\"<br>Checkers picked up his red ball and went<br>before Mr. President. Mr. President asked<br>him his name and where he lived. Checkers<br>answered in a clear, sweet voice.<br>Next Mr . President asked him, \\\"Can you<br>do anything?\\\"<br>\\\"I can retrieve,\\\" answered Checkers.<br>Checkers rolled his ball to Jenny, who<br>batted it with her paw across the moonlit<br>grass. He dashed after it, brought it back<br>and laid it before Mr. President.<br>No one had ever seen such fine retrieving.<br>The members raised their paws and voted<br>Checkers into the Club.<br>As Checkers returned to his seat, Jenny<br>made a silent prayer: \\\"Please may Edward<br>pass his test, too.\\\"<br>Then Edward was called before Mr.<br>President, who asked him the usual<br>questions: name, address and what he could do.<br>To this last question Edward answered, \\\"I<br>can write.\\\"<br>\\\"Please read a writing,\\\" said Mr.<br>President.<br>Edward said, \\\"I shall recite a poem.\\\"<br>\\\"A poem!\\\" shouted The Duke. \\\"Who<br>wants to hear a sissy poem?\\\"<br>This rudeness startled Edward. His voice<br>left him. Standing alone in the ring, he looked<br>so helpless that Jenny was frightened.<br>After a long time Edward stammered in a<br>little, tiny voice, \\\"I am a ghost.\\\"<br>A ghost! Though he had said it softly,<br>Jenny and the other members caught the<br>scary word. Their fur stood up. Their<br>whiskers twitched - and shivered! Sinbad and<br>The Duke called out to Edward, \\\"Louder,<br>please! And start again!\\\"<br>This time, in a stronger voice, Edward<br>said, \\\"A Poem by Edward Brandywine\\\"<br>A POEM<br>BY<br>EDWARD BRANDYWINE<br>I am a ghost.<br>Though I don\\'t want to boast,<br>I\\'m the ghost of a pirate cat -<br>That\\'s that.<br>In times gone by,<br>Oh me, oh my!<br>In another life<br>I carried a knife<br>With a pointed tip<br>At my snarling lip<br>And sailed on a ship<br>With a sword at my hip<br>As a pirate cat -<br>That\\'s that.<br>With a hearty meow<br>I\\'d leap from the prow<br>To another ship\\'s deck<br>And there I\\'d wreck<br>All cats on board<br>With my trusty sword<br>And the knife from my lip<br>And the tigerish skip<br>Of a pirate cat -<br>That\\'s that.<br>As time flew by<br>My crimes piled high.<br>But what did I care<br>As I sailed here and there<br>Till, alas! I was caught.<br>What a battle I fought!<br>But they whisked me apart<br>And pickled my heart,<br>And my life on a ship<br>With a knife at my lip<br>As a pirate cat<br>Fell flat.<br>Now in olden times, when this tale<br>took place,<br>A wicked cat was granted a grace:<br>Nine lives had he -<br>Nine chances to be<br>A good, respectable cat.<br>So here at last,<br>With my crimes long past,<br>I stand expectant-ly.<br>More tales I could tell<br>And they\\'d all sound well.<br>A rhyming cat - that\\'s me.<br>Edward bowed graciously to indicate that<br>his poem was finished. Modestly he tried to<br>return to his seat. But the other cats were<br>pushing toward him, cheering the great<br>writer, Edward Brandywine. Immediately<br>they voted him into the Club.<br>\\\"Speech, Edward! Speech!\\\" cried Sinbad,<br>whose whiskers were still shivering with<br>excitement from the pirate poem.<br>The Duke and the other members took up<br>the cry: \\\"Speech, Edward! Speech!\\\"<br>Jenny gazed proudly at her brother<br>Edward as he said, \\\"I wish to thank the Cat Club<br>for the great honor it has paid me.\\\"<br>\\\"How beautifully he speaks and writes,\\\"<br>thought Jenny.<br>Then she could hear Edward say, \\\"I also<br>wish to thank my little sister, Jenny Linsky.<br>If Jenny hadn\\'t helped me, I could never<br>have written my poem.\\\"<br>\\\"Me?\\\" wondered Jenny. \\\"What did I do?\\\"<br>And Sinbad said to Edward, \\\"Tell us,<br>what did Jenny do?\\\"<br>Edward smiled.<br>\\\"Jenny helped me find the proper kind of<br>poem to write,\\\" he answered. \\\"She told me I<br>should make your whiskers shiver.\\\"<br>Someone with a heavy paw pushed Jenny<br>through the crowd. She stood happily<br>between her brothers while the Cat Club gave<br>three cheers for Jenny Linsky.","char_name":"JENNY"},{"book_id":"L107","text":"Here comes the judge<br>in her big red hat.<br>She has come to see the train show.<br>Who will take the judge to the train show?<br>Thomas will!<br>Thomas will go.<br>Thomas will take the judge to the show.<br>\\\"Hurry, Thomas!

He thought no engine<br>worked as hard as he did. So he used to<br>play tricks on them. He liked best of all to<br>come quietly beside a big engine dozing<br>on a siding and make him jump.<br>\\\"Peep, peep, peep, pip, peep! Wake up, lazybones!\\\" he would<br>whistle. \\\"Why don\\'t you work hard like me?\\\"<br>Then he would laugh rudely and run away to find some<br>more coaches.<br>One day, Gordon was resting on a siding. He was very tired.<br>The big Express he always pulled had been late, and he had<br>had to run as fast as he could to make up for lost time.<br>He was just going to sleep when Thomas came up in his<br>cheeky way.<br>\\\"Wake up, lazybones,\\\" he whistled. \\\"Do some hard work<br>for a change -- you can\\'t catch me!\\\" and he ran off laughing.<br>Instead of going to sleep again, gordon thought how he<br>could get Thomas back.<br>One morning, Thomas wouldn\\'t wake him up. His Driver and<br>Fireman couldn\\'t make him start.<br>His fire went out, and there<br>was not enough steam.<br>It was nearly time for the<br>Express. The people were<br>waiting, but the coaches<br>weren\\'t ready.<br>At last, Thomas started. \\\"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\\\" he yawned.<br>\\\"Come on,\\\" said the coaches. \\\"Hurry up.\\\" Thomas gave<br>them a rude bump and started for the station.<br>\\\"Don\\'t dawdle, don\\'t dawdle,\\\" he grumbled.<br>\\\"Where have you been? Where have you been?\\\" asked the<br>coaches crossly.<br>Thomas fussed into the station, where Gordon was waiting.<br>\\\"Poop, poop, poop. Hurry up, you,\\\" said Gordon crossly.<br>\\\"Peep, pip, peep. Hurry yourself,\\\" said cheeky Thomas.<br>\\\"Yes,\\\" said Gordon, \\\"I will.\\\" And almost before the coaches<br>had stopped moving, Gordon came out of his siding and was<br>coupled to the train.<br>\\\"Poop, poop,\\\" he whistled. \\\"Get in quickly, please.\\\" So the<br>people got in quickly, the signal went down, the clock struck<br>the hour, the Guard waved his green flag,<br>and Gordon was ready to start.<br>Thomas usually pushed behind the<br>big trains to help them start. But he was always uncoupled first<br>so that, when the train was running nicely, he could stop and<br>go back.<br>This time, he was late, and Gordon started so quickly that<br>they forgot to uncouple Thomas.<br>\\\"Poop, poop,\\\" said Gordon.<br>\\\"Peep, peep, peep\\\" whistled Thomas.<br>\\\"Come on! Come on!\\\" puffed Gordon to the coaches.<br>\\\"Pull harder! Pull harder!\\\" puffed Thomas to Gordon.<br>The heavy train slowly began to move out of the station.<br>The train went faster and faster -- too fast for Thomas. He<br>wanted to stop, but he couldn\\'t.<br>\\\"Peep! Peep! Stop! Stop!\\\" he whistled.<br>\\\"Hurry, hurry, hurry,\\\" laughed Gordon in front.<br>\\\"You can\\'t get away. You can\\'t get away,\\\" laughed the<br>coaches.<br>Poor Thomas was going faster than he had ever gone<br>before. He was out of breath and his wheels hurt him, but<br>he had to go on.<br>\\\"I shall never be the same again,\\\" he thought sadly. \\\"My<br>wheels will be quite worn out.\\\"<br>At last, they stopped at a station. Everyone laughed to see<br>Thomas puffing and panting behind.<br>They uncoupled him, put him on a turntable, and then he<br>ran on a siding out of the way.<br>\\\"Well, little Thomas,\\\" chuckled Gordon as he passed.<br>\\\"Now you know what hard work means, don\\'t you?\\\"<br>Poor Thomas couldn\\'t answer. He had no breath. He just<br>puffed slowly away to rest and had a long, long drink.<br>He went home very slowly and was careful afterwards never<br>to be cheeky to Gordon again.<br>THOMAS\\' TRAIN<br>Thomas often grumbled because he was not allowed to<br>pull passenger trains.<br>The other engines laughed. \\\"You\\'re too impatient,\\\" they<br>said. \\\"You\\'d be sure to leave something behind!\\\"<br>\\\"Rubbish,\\\" said Thomas crossly. \\\"You just wait. I\\'ll show<br>you.\\\"<br>One night, he and Henry were alone. Henry was ill. The<br>men worked hard, but he didn\\'t get better.<br>Now Henry usually pulled the first train in the morning,<br>and Thomas had to get his coaches ready.<br>\\\"If Henry is ill,\\\" he thought, \\\"perhaps I shall pull his train.\\\"<br>Thomas ran to find the coaches.<br>\\\"Come along. Come along,\\\" he fussed.<br>\\\"There\\'s plenty of time, there\\'s plenty of time,\\\" grumbled<br>the coaches.<br>He took them to the platform and wanted to run round<br>in front at once. But his Driver<br>wouldn\\'t let him.<br>\\\"Don\\'t be impatient,<br>Thomas,\\\" he said.<br>So Thomas waited<br>and waited. The people<br>got in, the Guard and<br>Station Master walked up<br>and down, the porters banged<br>the doors, and still Henry<br>didn\\'t come.<br>Thomas got more and more excited every minute.<br>Sir Topham Hatt came out of his office to see what was the<br>matter, and the Guard and the Station Master told him about<br>Henry.<br>\\\"Find another engine,\\\" he ordered.<br>\\\"There\\'s only Thomas,\\\" they said.<br>\\\"You\\'ll have to do it, then, Thomas. Be quick now!\\\"<br>So Thomas ran round to the front and backed up to the<br>coaches, ready to start.<br>\\\"Don\\'t be impatient,\\\" said his Driver. \\\"Wait till everything<br>is ready.\\\"<br>But Thomas was too excited to listen to a word he said.<br>What happened then, no one knows. Perhaps they forgot<br>to couple Thomas to the train, perhaps Thomas was too<br>impatient to wait till they were ready, or perhaps his Driver<br>pulled the lever by mistake.<br>Anyhow, Thomas started. People shouted and waved at<br>him, but he didn\\'t stop.<br>\\\"They\\'re waving because I\\'m such<br>a splendid engine,\\\" he thought<br>importantly. \\\"Henry says it\\'s hard<br>to pull trains, but I think it\\'s easy.\\\"<br>\\\"Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!\\\" he<br>puffed, pretending to be like<br>Gordon.<br>As he passed the first signal box, he<br>saw the men leaning out, waving and<br>shouting.<br>\\\"They\\'re pleased to see me,\\\" he thought. \\\"They\\'ve never<br>seen me pulling a train before. It\\'s nice of them to wave.\\\" And<br>he whistled, \\\"Peep, peep, thank you,\\\" and hurried on.<br>But he came to a signal -- \\\"Danger.\\\"<br>\\\"Bother!\\\" he thought. \\\"I must stop, and I was going so<br>nicely, too. What a nuisance signals are!\\\" And he blew an<br>angry \\\"peep, peep\\\" on his whistle.<br>One of the Signalmen ran up. \\\"Hullo, Thomas!\\\" he said.<br>\\\"What are you doing here?\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'m pulling a train,\\\" said Thomas proudly. \\\"Can\\'t you see?\\\"<br>\\\"Where are your coaches, then?\\\"<br>Thomas looked back. \\\"Why, bless me,\\\" he said, \\\"if we<br>haven\\'t left them behind!\\\"<br>\\\"Yes,\\\" said the Signalmen, \\\"you\\'d better go back quickly<br>and fetch them.\\\"<br>Poor Thomas was so sad he nearly cried.<br>\\\"Cheer up!\\\" said his Driver. \\\"Let\\'s go back quickly and<br>try again.\\\"<br>At the station, all the passengers were talking at once. They<br>were telling Sir Topham Hatt, the Station Master, and the<br>Guard what a bad railway it was.<br>But when Thomas came back and they saw how sad he was,<br>they couldn\\'t be cross. So they coupled him to the train, and<br>this time he really pulled it.<br>But for a long time afterwards the other engines laughed at<br>Thomas, and said:<br>\\\"Look, there\\'s Thomas, who wanted to pull a train but<br>forgot about the coaches!\\\"<br>THOMAS AND THE FREIGHT CARS<br>Thomas used to grumble in the Shed at night. \\\"I\\'m tired<br>of pushing coaches. I want to see the world.\\\"<br>The others didn\\'t take much notice, for Thomas was a little<br>engine who talked big.<br>But one night, Edward came to the Shed. He was a kind<br>little engine and felt sorry for Thomas.<br>\\\"I\\'ve got some freight cars to take home tomorrow,\\\" he told<br>him. \\\"If you take them instead, I\\'ll push coaches in the Yard.\\\"<br>\\\"Thank you,\\\" said Thomas, \\\"that will be nice.\\\"<br>So they asked their Drivers the next morning, and when<br>they said \\\"Yes,\\\" Thomas ran happily to find the freight cars.<br>Now, freight cars are silly and noisy. They talk a lot and<br>don\\'t attend to what they are doing. They don\\'t listen to<br>their engine, and when he stops, they bump into each other,<br>screaming, \\\"Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Whatever is happening?\\\"<br>And, I\\'m sorry to say, they play tricks on an engine who is<br>not used to them.<br>Edward knew all about freight cars. He warned Thomas to<br>be careful, but Thomas was too excited to listen.<br>The Switchman fastened the coupling, and when the signal<br>dropped, Thomas was ready.<br>The Guard blew his whistle. \\\"Peep! Peep!\\\" answered Thomas,<br>and started off.<br>But the freight cars weren\\'t ready.<br>\\\"Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!\\\" they screamed as their couplings<br>tightened. \\\"Wait, Thomas, wait.\\\" But Thomas wouldn\\'t wait.<br>\\\"Come-on. Come-on,\\\" he puffed, and the freight cars<br>grumbled slowly out of the siding onto the Main Line.<br>Thomas was happy. \\\"Come along. Come along,\\\" he puffed.<br>\\\"All--right!--Don\\'t--fuss.--All--right!--Don\\'t fuss,\\\"<br>grumbled the freight cars. They clattered through stations and<br>rumbled over bridges.<br>Thomas whistled, \\\"Peep! Peep!\\\" and they rushed through the<br>tunnel in which Henry had been shut up.<br>Then they came to the top of the hill where Gordon had<br>gotten stuck.<br>\\\"Steady now, steady,\\\" warned the Driver, and he shut off<br>steam and began to put on the brakes.<br>\\\"We\\'re stopping, we\\'re stopping,\\\" called Thomas.<br>\\\"No! No! No! No!\\\" answered the<br>freight cars, and bumped into<br>each other. \\\"Go -- on! -- Go -- on!\\\" And before his<br>Driver could stop them, they<br>had pushed Thomas down<br>the hill, and were rattling and<br>laughing behind him.<br>Poor Thomas tried hard to stop<br>them from making him go too fast.<br>\\\"Stop pushing, stop pushing,\\\" he hissed, but the freight cars<br>would not stop.<br>\\\"Go -- on! -- Go -- on!\\\" they giggled in their silly way.<br>He was glad when they got to the bottom. Then<br>he saw the place where they had to stop.<br>\\\"Oh, dear! What shall I do?\\\"<br>They rattled through the station, and luckily the line was<br>clear as they swerved into the Freight Yard.<br>\\\"Oo-----ooh e-----r,\\\" groaned Thomas as<br>his brakes held fast and he skidded along the rails.<br>\\\"I must stop.\\\" And he shut his eyes tight.<br>When he opened them, he saw he had stopped just in front<br>of the buffers, and there watching<br>him was -- Sir Topham Hatt!<br>\\\"What are you doing here, Thomas?\\\" he asked sternly.<br>\\\"I\\'ve brought Edward\\'s freight cars,\\\" Thomas answered.<br>\\\"Why did you come so fast?\\\"<br>\\\"I didn\\'t mean to. I was pushed,\\\" said Thomas sadly.<br>\\\"Haven\\'t you pulled freight cars before?\\\"<br>\\\"No.\\\"<br>\\\"Then you\\'ve got a lot to learn about freight cars, little<br>Thomas. They are silly things<br>and must be kept in their<br>place. After pushing them<br>about here for a few<br>weeks, you\\'ll know<br>almost as much about<br>them as Edward. Then<br>you\\'ll be a Really<br>Useful Engine.\\\"<br>THOMAS AND THE BREAKDOWN TRAIN<br>Every day, Sir Topham Hatt came to the station to catch<br>his train, and he always said \\\"Hullo\\\" to Thomas.<br>There were lots of freight cars in the Yard -- different ones<br>came in every day -- and Thomas had to push and pull them<br>into their right places.<br>He worked hard -- he knew now that he wasn\\'t so clever as<br>he had thought. Besides, Sir Topham Hatt had been kind to<br>him, and he wanted to learn all about freight cars so he could<br>be a Really Useful Engine.<br>But on a siding by themselves were some freight cars that<br>Thomas was told he \\\"mustn\\'t touch.\\\"<br>There was a small coach, some flatbed cars, and two strange<br>things his Driver called cranes.<br>\\\"That\\'s the breakdown train,\\\" he said. \\\"When there\\'s an<br>accident, the workmen get into the coach and the engine takes<br>them quickly to help the hurt people and to clear and mend<br>the line. The cranes are for lifting heavy things like engines and<br>coaches and freight cars.\\\"<br>One day, Thomas was in the Yard when he heard an<br>engine whistling, \\\"Help! Help!\\\" and a freight train came<br>rushing through much too fast.<br>The engine (a new one called James) was frightened. His<br>brake blocks were on fire, and smoke and sparks streamed out<br>on each side.<br>\\\"They\\'re pushing me!<br>They\\'re pushing me!\\\"<br>he panted.<br>\\\"On! On! On! On!\\\"<br>laughed the freight cars.<br>\\\"Help! Help!\\\" yelled<br>poor James as he<br>disappeared under<br>a bridge.<br>\\\"I\\'d like to teach those freight cars a lesson,\\\" said Thomas<br>the Tank Engine.<br>Presently, a bell rang in the signal box, and a man came<br>running. \\\"James is off the line -- the breakdown train --<br>quickly!\\\" he shouted.<br>So Thomas was coupled on, the workmen jumped into their<br>coach, and off they went.<br>Thomas worked his hardest. \\\"Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!\\\" he<br>puffed, and this time he wasn\\'t pretending to be like<br>Gordon -- he really meant it.<br>\\\"Bother those freight cars and their tricks,\\\" he thought.<br>\\\"I hope poor James isn\\'t hurt.\\\"<br>They found James and the freight cars at a bend in the line.<br>The brake van and the last few freight cars were on the rails,<br>but the front ones were piled in a heap; James was in a field<br>with a cow looking at him, and his Driver and Fireman were<br>feeling him all over to see if he was hurt.<br>\\\"Never mind, James,\\\" they said. \\\"It wasn\\'t your fault. It was<br>those wooden brakes they gave you. We always said they were<br>no good.\\\"<br>Thomas pushed the breakdown train alongside. Then he<br>pulled the unhurt freight cars out of the way.<br>\\\"Oh -- dear! -- Oh -- dear!\\\" they groaned.<br>\\\"Serves you right. Serves you right,\\\" puffed Thomas<br>crossly.<br>When the men put other freight cars<br>on the line, he pulled them away,<br>too. He was hard at work, puff-<br>ing backwards and forwards,<br>all the afternoon.<br>\\\"This\\'ll teach you a lesson,<br>this\\'ll teach you a lesson,\\\" he<br>told the freight cars, and<br>they answered, \\\"Yes-it--<br>will. --Yes--it--will,\\\" in a sad,<br>groany, creaky sort of voice.<br>They left the broken freight cars and<br>mended the line. Then, with the two cranes, they put James<br>back on the rails. He tried to move, but he couldn\\'t, so<br>Thomas helped him back to the Shed.<br>Sir Topham Hatt was waiting anxiously for them.<br>\\\"Well, Thomas,\\\" he said kindly, \\\"I\\'ve heard all about it, and<br>I\\'m very pleased with you. You\\'re a Really Useful Engine.<br>\\\"James shall have some proper brakes and a new coat of<br>paint, and you...¦ shall have a Branch<br>Line all to yourself.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh, Sir!\\\" said Thomas<br>happily.<br>Now Thomas is as happy as can<br>be. He has a Branch Line all to<br>himself, and puffs proudly<br>backwards and forwards with two<br>coaches all day.<br>He is never lonely, because there is always<br>some engine to talk to at the junction.<br>Edward and Henry stop quite often and tell him the news.<br>Gordon is always in a hurry and does not stop, but he never<br>forgets to say \\\"Poop, poop\\\" to little Thomas, and Thomas<br>always whistles \\\"Peep, peep\\\" in return.","char_name":"THOMAS"},{"book_id":"L109","text":"**This looks like an<br>ordinary box full of ordinary yarn.<br>But it turns out it isn\\'t.**<br>On a cold afternoon in a cold little town,<br>where everywhere you looked was either the white of snow<br>or the black of soot from chimneys,<br>Annabelle found a box filled with yarn of every color.<br>So she went home and<br>knit herself a sweater.<br>And when Annabelle was done, she had<br>some extra yarn.<br>So she knit a sweater for Mars, too.<br>But there was still extra yarn.<br>And when Annabelle and Mars went<br>for a walk, Nate pointed and laughed<br>and said, \\'You two look ridiculous.\\'<br>\\'You\\'re just jealous,\\'<br>said Annabelle.<br>\\'No, I\\'m not,\\' said Nate.<br>But it turned out he was.<br>And even after she\\'d made a sweater for Nate<br>and his dog, and for herself and for Mars,<br>she still had extra yarn.<br>At school, Annabelle\\'s classmates could<br>not stop talking about her sweater.<br>\\'Quiet!\\' shouted Mr. Norman.<br>\\'Quiet, everyone!

Lucy smeared ketchup on her toast. She turned to her grandpa and<br>said, \\'Pap Gino, Harriet said she\\'s never heard of ketchup on toast.<br>Her family uses butter and jelly.\\'<br>\\'It\\'s okay, not everyone likes the same thing, Lucy. It doesn\\'t mean one person is<br>right or wrong. We\\'re all different. What a boring world it would be if we were<br>all exactly alike! Do you remember what\\'s really important?\\' Papa Gino asked.<br>\\'Yes, Papa. Even if we are different from others on the outside, we all have a<br>heart with feelings on the inside.\\'<br>\\'That\\'s my girl! Remember, when you treat others with love and kindness, you<br>are doing the right thing,\\' Pap Gino replied.<br>On the school bus, Lucy and her friend Harriet pulled out some paper and<br>crayons. Sitting across from them was Ralph. As usual, Ralph sat alone, staring<br>out the window. He looked over at them and rolled his eyes.<br>In the classroom, Lucy sat down near the teacher. Miss Marcia waited to begin<br>as the children settled into their seats. Ralph carelessly hurried over and tripped<br>on Lucy\\'s foot. Before long, he was glaring at her.<br>Ralph whispered, \\'Woof! I can\\'t see the book with this poodle in front of<br>me.\\' Lucy could hear him giggling behind her. Oh no, why did it have to be<br>me? She wondered.<br>**Friendship week: share a smile!**<br>During lunch, Harriet shouted one of her silly jokes over the other children\\'s<br>voices. As the girls ate, their bellies shook with laughter.<br>Across the table, Ralph hollered, \\'Yuck. That\\'s the disgusting smell.<br>Whoever heard of eating spaghetti in a hot dog bun? Don\\'t you think<br>that\\'s gross, Tony?\\'<br>Tony and the other children at the table turned away from Ralph, shaking their<br>heads. Ralph continued, \\'Poor little Lucy with her hair so poofy!\\' Tears filled<br>Lucy\\'s eyes, and she began to cry.<br>On the way home, Lucy thought about what had happened. Maybe Ralph is mean<br>to me because he thinks being different is bad. I wish he would stop teasing me.<br>Slowly, Lucy stepped off the bus. \\'How was your day?\\' Papa Gino asked.<br>\\'Fine,\\' she mumbled. Papa reached over and pulled a crayon out of her hair.<br>\\'How did this happen?\\' he asked. Lucy didn\\'t say a word.<br>That night, as Papa Gino tucked Lucy into bed, he asked, \\'Is everything all<br>right at school?\\' Lucy rolled over. He leaned down, kissed her on the cheek,<br>and whispered, \\'Always remember, Papa is<br>here for you. If something\\'s not right, we<br>can work on fixing it together.\\'<br>It\\'s not that easy, thought Lucy. How do I<br>stop Ralph from teasing me? How can he<br>have a heart and be so mean?<br>Lucy had a hard time falling asleep, worrying what would happen tomorrow.<br>The following day, Lucy was surprised to find Ralph leaving her alone, until...<br>\\'Lucy, I\\'m sorry about yesterday,\\' Ralph snickered. Lucy took the bag Ralph<br>handed her. Inside were dog bones and a picture with a note that read:<br>Lucy, Lucy, eats stinky food that puts us in a big, bad mood.<br>Lucy, Lucy, hair shaped like a cone, here\\'s a treat for you-<br>a yummy dog bone!<br>The beating of Lucy\\'s heart was so loud she knew everyone around her could<br>hear it. Her body began to tremble as she tore the note into pieces. \\'Stop! It<br>hurts my feelings when you do this, Ralph,\\' Lucy said. \\'Please stop!\\' Ralph<br>turned and walked away.<br>It was recess time, and Lucy played alone. She didn\\'t want to tell Miss Marcia<br>about Ralph. She was afraid of being a tattletale. Lucy wished Papa Gino was<br>there to help. What should I do? she asked herself over and over. The bell<br>rang as recess ended.<br>\\'Heeeeelllllppppp!\\' cried a child off in the distance. Tony ran up and yelled,<br>\\'Ralph got himself stuck at the top of the monkey bars. It\\'s the funniest thing<br>I\\'ve ever seen!\\'<br>\\'This is my chance, I\\'ll go tell Ralph how mean he really is-M-E-A-N, mean!\\'<br>Lucy said under her breath. She stomped off toward the monkey bars.<br>When she reached Ralph, Lucy paused. She looked him in the eye and said,<br>\\'What you did was so mean!\\' Standing before Ralph, Lucy could hear her<br>papa\\'s words. Ralph did have a heart with feelings.<br>In that moment, she decided what she would do. Lucy<br>started to climb up the monkey bars. She saw tears<br>in Ralph\\'s eyes. He hesitated to move and whispered,<br>\\'I\\'m scared.\\' Lucy reached for him and said, \\'Here,<br>take my hand,\\' and she helped him down.<br>The two walked back to the classroom without saying a word.<br>On the way home, Lucy sang songs with Harriet. As the bus pulled up to her<br>stop, Ralph suddenly reached over and handed her a picture. Lucy was<br>amazed by what she saw. \\'Thanks,\\' she muttered softly.<br>After she got off the bus, Lucy reached for her papa\\'s hand and said,<br>\\'Papa, there\\'s this boy Ralph who was really mean to me.<br>Today he was in trouble, and I helped him.\\'<br>Papa Gino hugged Lucy and replied, \\'That took a lot of courage. It wasn\\'t the<br>easiest thing to do. You chose to be a good person and to treat others the way<br>you want to be treated. I\\'m so proud of you, Lucy.\\'<br>As they walked home, she asked him what was for dinner.

Everyone in Japan has black hair. Not red, not yellow, not green, just black.<br>Narrow streets whizzed by. Little houses and stores. People on bicycles, people walking.<br>Our hotel was a ryokan, which is like a Japanese home. You take your shoes off before you step inside, so you must make sure that your socks don\\'t have holes. You walk on mats called tatami. And you sleep on the floor on a cushy pad called a futon and cover yourself with a quilt as soft as a cloud. We sat on the floor at a table and had jasmine tea and rice crackers.<br>Outside our window we heard music. Under fluttering cherry blossoms women danced to the playing of flutes.<br>The door knocked. In walked our guide, Hiroko. She was going to show us many places.<br>Alexander made up a poem that I was very proud of.<br>Hey Hiroko, are you loco? Would you like a cup of cocoa?<br>We opened the present that Hiroko brought - a book with pictures of schoolchildren many years ago. They were dressed in beautiful robes called kimonos. Now children wear school uniforms and the girls have braids that point to the ground. We wanted to meet the children at school. We jumped up.<br>\\\"I will take you,\\\" said Hiroko. We went to the subway.<br>The subway was shining and quiet. The workers stood in crisp uniforms. The train smoothed into the station and was full of people. We were like marshmallows all stuffed together in a bag bouncing along, but nobody stuck their elbow in my ear.<br>In the school, the children bowed hello, singing a good morning song. Other children were reading a story about a man who traveled to a magic castle under the sea on the back of a turtle. Other children were learning music and the birds chirped on trees.<br>Walking in the sun, we passed a man sitting on a bench. His black, crooked cane poked the ground and looked like a snake.<br>We went to a noodle restaurant. Alexander said they served oodles and poodles of noodles. The waiter brought us little hot wet white towels. We wiped our hands. The bowls of noodles arrived with chopsticks. Alexander\\'s chopsticks kept flipping and flying through the air. I taught him how to use them and we all slurped our noodles, which is a perfectly fine thing to do in Japan.<br>Strolling along, we came to a rock garden. There were big rocks that were like islands. All around them, sand was raked into patterns like the ocean. And even if one tiny leaf fell on the sand, a gardener would come and pluck it away using a long pole with a pin on the end. In the pond, big spotted carp wiggled to our feet. The quiet was so quiet that the quiet filled the air.<br>Suddenly, a frog spoke to us. \\\"Excuse me, would you like to hear my haiku?\\\"<br>A frog is no frog<br>if he is a prince which I<br>am certainly not<br>We went to eat. At the restaurant we took off our shoes. Alexander was sure they were cooking our shoes.<br>Shoe soup?<br>Shoe sandwiches?<br>Shoe pie?<br>But really it was rice and vegetables tied with tiny seaweed bows.<br>It was a dreamy night. We wandered through the city and went to a movie called Godzilla. This giant lizard clomped around Tokyo scaring everyone and Alexander said, \\\"That Godzilla is my friend.\\\"<br>The next morning Hiroko came to our door.<br>\\\"This is a fishy morning,\\\" she announced. \\\"I would like to take you to the fish market.\\\"<br>There are little places to eat raw fish called sushi, which frog boy (as I sometimes call my slippery brother) calls squishy.<br>We walked to an old temple where people tied zillions of little pieces of paper with wishes on them to a tree.

Here?\\\"<br>\\\"No, up there.\\\"<br>She pointed to a mountain. We got on a little wooden train.<br>In the middle of a pine forest was the bath. Alexander wanted to jump right in, but there are things you must do first. Like take off all your clothes. We sat on benches, scrubbed like crazy and rinsed with buckets of water. Then we scrubbed some more and rinsed some more.

She said, \\\"Today I would like to take you on a very fast train. So fast it is called the Bullet Train.\\\" The train was so fast we were back before we left. That\\'s fast.<br>Hiroko\\'s best friend, a beautiful movie star named Fujiko gave us a good-bye party. Paper lanterns swung in the breeze. The evening was warm. Alexander, my little brother spoke his farewell poem.<br>Oh, Japan kids<br>you eat raw fish<br>a crazy dish<br>the way you bow<br>is really wow<br>Hai is yes<br>and Noh is a show<br>I\\'ve got to iku<br>which means go.<br>Sayonara and good-bye<br>please don\\'t cry<br>you might swallow<br>a fly.<br>Full of presents we flew, into the arms of our parents.

He had no brothers<br>or sisters, and he was very sad<br>and lonely at home.<br>Once he brought home a lost<br>cat, and some time later a stray<br>puppy. But his mother said<br>animals brought dirt into the<br>house, and so Pascal was soon<br>alone again in his mother\\'s<br>clean well-kept rooms.<br>Then one day, on his way to<br>school, he caught sight of a fine<br>red balloon, tied to a street lamp.<br>Pascal laid his school bag on<br>the ground. He climbed up the<br>lamppost, untied the balloon,<br>and ran off with it to the bus stop.<br>But the conductor knew the rules. \\\"No dogs,\\\" he said. \\\"No large packages,<br>no balloons.\\\"<br>People with dogs walk.<br>People with packages take taxis.<br>People with balloons leave them behind.<br>Pascal did not want to leave his balloon behind, so the conductor rang the<br>signal bell and the bus went on without him.<br>Pascal\\'s school was a long way off, and when he finally reached the school<br>door it was already shut. To be late for school and with a balloon - that was<br>unheard of! Pascal was very worried.<br>Then he had an idea. He left his balloon with the janitor, who was sweeping<br>the yard. And since it was the first time that he had ever been late, he was<br>not punished.<br>When school was over, the janitor, who had kept the balloon in his room for<br>Pascal, gave it back to him.<br>But it had begun to rain. And Pascal had to walk home because of those silly<br>rules about balloons on buses. But he thought his balloon shouldn\\'t get wet.<br>There was an old gentleman just going by, and Pascal asked him whether he<br>and the balloon could take shelter under his umbrella. So, from one umbrella<br>to another, Pascal made his way home.<br>His mother was glad to see him finally come home. But since she had been<br>very worried, she was angry when she found out that it was a balloon that had<br>made Pascal late. She took the balloon, opened the window, and threw it out.<br>Now, usually when you let a balloon go, it flies away. But Pascal\\'s balloon<br>stayed outside the window, and the two of them looked at each other through<br>the glass. Pascal was surprised that his balloon hadn\\'t flown away, but not<br>really as surprised as all that. Friends will do all kinds of things for you. If the<br>friend happens to be a balloon, it doesn\\'t fly away. So Pascal opened his<br>window quietly, took his balloon back inside, and hid it in his room.<br>The next day, before he left for school, Pascal opened the window to let his<br>balloon out and told it to come to him when he called.<br>Then he picked up his school bag, kissed his mother good-by, and went<br>downstairs.<br>When he reached the street he called: \\\"Balloon! Balloon!\\\" and the balloon<br>came flying down to him.<br>Then it began to follow Pascal - without being led by a string, just as if it were a dog following its master.<br>But, like a dog, it didn\\'t always<br>do as it was told. When Pascal<br>Tried to catch it to cross the<br>Street, the balloon flew beyond<br>His reach.<br>Pascal decided to pretend he<br>didn\\'t care. He walked up the<br>street just as if the balloon<br>weren\\'t there at all and hid be-<br>hind the corner of a house. The<br>balloon got worried and hurried<br>to catch up with him.<br>When they got to the bus stop,<br>Pascal said to the balloon: \\\"Now,<br>balloon, you follow me. Don\\'t lose<br>sight of the bus!\\\"<br>That was how the strangest sight<br>came to be seen in a Paris street-<br>a balloon flying along behind<br>a bus.<br>When they reached Pascal\\'s school, the balloon again tried not to let itself be<br>caught. But the bell was already ringing and the door was just about to close,<br>so Pascal had to hurry in alone. He was very worried.<br>But the balloon flew over the school wall and got in line behind the children.<br>The teacher was very surprised to see this strange new pupil, and when the<br>balloon tried to follow them into the classroom, the children made so much<br>noise that the principal came along to see what was happening.<br>The principal tried to catch the balloon to put it out the door. But he couldn\\'t.<br>So he took Pascal by the hand and marched him out of school. The balloon left<br>the classroom and followed them.<br>The principal had urgent business at the Town Hall, and he didn\\'t know what to<br>do with Pascal and his balloon. So he locked the boy up inside his office. The<br>balloon, he said to himself, would stay outside the door.<br>But that wasn\\'t the balloon\\'s idea at all. When it saw that the principal had put<br>the key in his pocket, it sailed along behind him as he walked down the street.<br>All the people knew the principal very well, and when they saw him walking<br>past followed by a balloon they shook their heads and said: \\\"The principal\\'s<br>playing a joke. It isn\\'t right; a principal should be dignified, he shouldn\\'t be<br>playing like one of the boys in his school.\\\"<br>The poor man tried very hard to catch the balloon, but he couldn\\'t, so there was<br>nothing for him to do but put up with it. Outside the Town Hall the balloon<br>stopped. It waited for him in the street, and when the principal went back to<br>school the balloon was still behind him.<br>The principal was only too glad to let Pascal out of his office, and to be rid of<br>him and his balloon.<br>On the way home Pascal stopped to look at a picture in a sidewalk exhibit. It<br>showed a little girl with a hoop. Pascal thought how nice it would be to have a<br>friend like that little girl.<br>But just at that moment he met a real little girl, looking just like the one in the<br>picture. She was wearing a pretty white dress, and she held in her hand the<br>string... to a blue balloon!<br>Pascal wanted to be sure she noticed that his balloon was a magic one. But<br>his balloon wouldn\\'t be caught, and the little girl began to laugh.<br>Pascal was angry. \\\"What\\'s the use of having a trained balloon if it won\\'t do<br>what you want?\\\" He said to himself. At that very moment some of the tough<br>boys of the neighborhood came by. They tried to catch the balloon as it trailed<br>Along behind Pascal. But the balloon saw the danger. It flew to Pascal at once.<br>He caught it and began to run, but more boys came to corner him from the<br>other side.<br>So Pascal let go of his balloon, which immediately rose high into the sky.<br>While the boys were all looking up, Pascal ran between them to the top of the<br>steps. From there he called his balloon, which came to him at once- to the great<br>surprise of the boys in the gang.<br>So Pascal and his balloon got home without being caught.<br>The next day was Sunday. Before he left for church, Pascal told his balloon to<br>stay quietly at home, not to break anything, and especially not go out.<br>But the balloon did exactly as it pleased. Pascal and his mother were hardly<br>seated in church when the balloon appeared and hung quietly in the air<br>behind them.<br>Now, a church is no place for a balloon. Everyone was looking at it and no one<br>was paying attention to the service. Pascal had to leave in a hurry, followed<br>out by the church guard. His balloon certainly had no sense of what was proper.<br>Pascal had plenty of worries!<br>All this worry had made him hungry. And as he still had his coin for the collec-<br>tion plate, he went into a bakeshop for some cake. Before he went inside he<br>said to the balloon: \\\"Now be good and wait for me. Don\\'t go away.\\\"<br>The balloon was good, and only went as far as the corner of the shop to warm<br>itself in the sun. But that was already too far. For the gang of boys who had<br>tried to catch it the day before saw it, and they thought that was the<br>moment to try again. Without being seen they crept up to it, jumped on it and<br>carried it away.<br>When Pascal came out of the bakeshop, there was no balloon! He ran in every<br>direction, looking up at the sky. The balloon had disobeyed him again! It had<br>gone off by itself! And although he called at the top of his voice, the balloon<br>did not come back.<br>The gang had tied the balloon to a strong string, and they were trying to teach<br>it tricks. \\\"We could show this magic balloon in a circus,\\\" one of them said. He<br>shook a stick at the balloon. \\\"Come here or I\\'ll burst you,\\\" he shouted.<br>As luck would have it, Pascal saw the balloon over the top of a wall, desper-<br>ately dragging at the end of its heavy string.

For a minute Pascal thought he had escaped<br>them, and he looked around for a place to rest. But as he rounded a corner he<br>bumped right into one of the gang. He ran back the way he had come, but<br>there were more boys there. He was desperate - he ran up a side street which<br>led to an empty lot. He thought he\\'d be safe there.<br>But suddenly boys appeared from every direction, and Pascal was surrounded.<br>So he let go of his balloon. But this time, instead of chasing the balloon, the gang<br>attacked Pascal. The balloon flew a little way off, but when it saw Pascal fight-<br>ing it came back. The boys began throwing stones at the balloon.<br>\\\"Fly away, balloon! Fly away!\\\" Pascal cried. But the balloon would not leave<br>its friend.<br>Then one of the stones hit the balloon, and it burst.<br>While Pascal was crying over his dead balloon, the strangest thing happened!<br>Everywhere balloons could be seen flying up into the air and forming a line<br>high into the sky.<br>It was the revolt of all captive balloons!<br>And all the balloons of Paris came down to Pascal, dancing around him,<br>twisting their strings into one strong one and lifting him up into the sky.<br>And that was how Pascal took a wonderful trip all around the world.","char_name":"PASCAL"},{"book_id":"L182","text":"Alligator pie, alligator pie.<br>If I don\\'t get some I think I\\'m gonna die.<br>Give away the green grass, give away the sky,<br>But don\\'t give away my alligator pie.<br>Alligator stew, alligator stew.<br>**No kids and this means you**<br>If I don\\'t get some I don\\'t know what I\\'ll do.<br>Give away my furry hat, give away my shoe,<br>But don\\'t give away my alligator stew.<br>Alligator soup, alligator soup.<br>If I don\\'t get some I think I\\'m gonna droop.<br>Give away my hockey stick, give away my hoop,<br>But don\\'t give away my alligator soup."},{"book_id":"L183","text":"Sun\\'s up!<br>Morning\\'s here.<br>Up and at em,<br>engineer.<br>Chugga-Chugga<br>choo-choo,<br>whistle blowing,<br>whoooooooo!<br>whoooooooo!<br>Hurry!

That was a long time ago,<br>and when we said good-bye, we took the name with us, as we didn\\'t think the swan<br>would want it any more. Well, when Edward Bear said that he would like an<br>exciting name all to himself, Christopher Robin said at once, without stopping<br>to think, that he was Winnie-the.Pooh. And he was. So, as I have explained the<br>Pooh part, I will now explain the rest of it.<br>You can\\'t be in London for long<br>without going to the Zoo. There are some people who begin the Zoo at the<br>beginning, called WAYIN, and walk as quickly as they can past every cage<br>until they get to the one called WA YOUT, but the nicest people go straight<br>to the animal they love the most, and stay there. So when Christopher Robin<br>goes to the Zoo, he goes to where the Polar Bears are, and he whispers<br>something to the third keeper from the left, and doors are unlocked, and we<br>wander through dark passages and up steep stairs, until at last we come to<br>the special cage, and the cage is opened, and out trots something brown and<br>furry, and with a happy cry of \\\"Oh, Bear!\\\" Christopher Robin rushes into its<br>arms. Now this bear\\'s name is Winnie, which shows what a good name for bears<br>it is, but the funny thing is that we can\\'t remember whether Winnie is called<br>after Pooh, or Pooh after Winnie. We did know once, but we have<br>forgotten. . . . I had written as far as this when Piglet looked up and said<br>in his squeaky voice, \\\"What about Me?\\\" \\\"My dear Piglet,\\\" I said, \\\"the whole<br>book is about you.\\\" \\\"So it is about Pooh,\\\" he squeaked. You see what it is.<br>He is jealous because he thinks Pooh is having a Grand Introduction all to<br>himself. Pooh is the favorite, of course, there\\'s no denying it, but Piglet<br>comes in for a good many things which Pooh misses; because you can\\'t take<br>Pooh to school without everybody knowing it, but Piglet is so small that he<br>slips into a pocket, where it is very comfortable to feel him when you are<br>not quite sure whether twice seven is twelve or twenty-two. Sometimes he<br>slips out and has a good look in the ink-pot, and in this way he has got more<br>education than Pooh, but Pooh doesn\\'t mind. Some have brains, and some haven\\'t,<br>he says, and there it is.<br>And now all the others are saying, \\\"What about Us?\\\"<br>So perhaps the best thing to do is to stop writing Introductions and get on<br>with the book.<br>CHAPTER I<br>In Which<br>We Are Introduced to Winnie-the-Pooh and Some Bees, and the Stories Begin<br>H<br>ERE IS Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back of<br>his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far as he knows, the only way of<br>coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there really is another way, if<br>only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it. And then he feels that<br>perhaps there isn\\'t. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready to be<br>introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.<br>When I first heard his name, I said, just<br>as you are going to say, \\\"But I thought he was a boy?\\\" \\\"So did I,\\\" said<br>Christopher Robin.<br>Then you can\\'t call him Winnie?\\\" \\\"don\\'t.\\\"<br>But you said--\\\"<br>\\\"He\\'s Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don\\'t you know what<br>\\'ter\\' means?\\\"<br>NIE-THE-POOH<br>\\\"Ah, e, now I do,\\\" I said quickly; and I hope you do too, because it is all<br>the explanation you are going to get.<br>Sometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of<br>some sort when he comes downstairs, and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in<br>front of the fire and listen to a story. This evening-.<br>\\\"What about a story?\\\" said Christopher Robin.<br>\\\"What about a story?\\\" I said.<br>\\\"Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?\\\"<br>I suppose I could,\\\" I said.<br>\\\"What sort of stories does he like?\\\"<br>\\\"About himself. Because he\\'s that sort of Bear.\\\" \\\"Oh, I see.\\\" \\\"So could you<br>very sweetly?\\\" \\'\\'I\\'ll try,\\\" I said. So I tried.<br>Once upon a time, a very long<br>time ago now, about last Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by<br>himself under the name of Sanders.<br>(\\\"What does \\'under the name\\' mean)\\\" asked Christopher Robin. \\\"It means he had<br>the name over the door in gold letters, and lived under it.\\\"<br>\\\"Winnie-the-Pooh wasn\\'t quite sure,\\\" said Christopher Robin.<br>WE ARE INTRODUCED<br>(Now I am, \\\"said a growly voice.<br>\\\"Then I will go on,\\\" said I.)<br>One day when he was out walking, he came to an<br>open place in the middle of the forest, and in the<br>middle of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from<br>the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-<br>noise.<br>Winnie-the-Pooh sat own at the foot of the<br>tree, put his head between his paws and began to<br>think.<br>First of all he said to himself: \\\"That buzzing-noise<br>means something. You don\\'t get a buzzing noise like<br>that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning<br>something. If there\\'s a buzzing -noise, somebody\\'s<br>making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making<br>a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you\\'re a bee.\\\"<br>Then he thought another long time, and said:<br>\\\"And the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey.\\\"<br>And then he got up, and said: \\\"And the only reason for making honey is so as<br>I can eat it.\\\"<br>So he began to climb the tree.<br>He<br>climbed<br>and<br>he<br>climbed<br>and<br>he<br>climbed,<br>and<br>as<br>he<br>climbed<br>he<br>sang<br>a<br>little<br>song<br>to<br>himself.<br>It<br>went<br>like<br>this:<br>isn\\'t it funny<br>How bear likes honey?<br>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!<br>I wonder why he does?<br>Then he climbed little further...<br>and a little further...and then just a little further. By that time<br>he had thought of another song.<br>It\\'s a very funny thought that, if Beas were Bees,<br>They\\'d build their nests at the bottom of trees.<br>And that being so (if the Bees were Bears),<br>We shouldn\\'t have to climb up all these stairs.<br>He was getting rather tired by this time, so that is why he sang a Complaining<br>Song.He was nearly there now, and if he just stood on that branch...<br>Crack!<br>\\\"Oh, help!\\\" said Pooh, as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him.<br>\\\"If only I hadn\\'t--\\\" he said, as he bounced<br>twenty feet on to the next branch. \\\"You see, what I meant to do,\\\"<br>he explained,<br>as he turned head-over-heels, and crashed on to another branch thirty feet<br>below, \\\"what I meant to do--\\\"<br>\\\"Of course, it was rather--\\\" he admitted, as he slithered very quickly<br>through the next six branches.<br>\\\"It all comes, I suppose,\\\" he decided, as he said good-bye to the last branch,<br>spun round three times, and flew gracefully into a gorse-bush,<br>\\\"it all comes of liking honey so much. Oh, help!\\\"<br>He crawled out of the gorse-bush, brushed the prickles from his nose,<br>and began to think again. And the first person he thought of was Christopher<br>Robin.<br>(\\\"Was that me?\\\" said Christopher Robin in an awed voice, hardly daring to<br>believe it. h was you. \\\"Christopher Robin said nothing, but his eyes got<br>larger and larger, and his face got pinker and pinker.)<br>So Winnie-the-Pooh went round to his friend Christopher Robin, who lived<br>behind a green door in another part of the forest.<br>\\\"Good morning, Christopher Robin,\\\" he said.<br>\\\"Good morning, Winnie-ther-Pooh,\\\" said you.<br>\\\"I wonder if you\\'ve got such a thing as a balloon about you?\\\"<br>\\\"A balloon?\\\"<br>\\\"Yes, I just said myself coming along: \\'I wonder<br>if Christopher Robin has such a thing as a balloon about him?\\' I just said it<br>to myself, thinking of balloons, and wondering.\\\"<br>\\\"What do you want a balloon for?\\\" you said.<br>Winnie-the-Pooh looked around to see that nobody was listening, put his paw<br>to his mouth, and said in a deep whisper: \\\"Honey!\\\"<br>\\\"But you don\\'t get honey<br>with balloons!\\\"<br>\\\"I do,\\\" said Pooh.<br>Well , it just happened that you had been to a party<br>the day before at the house of your friend Piglet, and<br>you had balloons at the party. You had had a big green balloon; and one of<br>Rabbit\\'s relations had had<br>a big blue one, and had left it behind,<br>being really too young to go to a party at all; and so you had brought the<br>green one and the blue one home with you.<br>Which one would you like\\\"you asked<br>Pooh.<br>He put his head between his paws and thought very carefully.<br>\\\"It\\'s like this,\\\" he said. \\\"When you go after honey<br>with a balloon,<br>the great thing is not to let the bees know you\\'re coming. Now, if you have a<br>green balloon, they might think you were only part of the tree, and not notice<br>you, and if you have a blue balloon, they might think you were only part of the<br>sky, and not notice you, and the question is: Which is most likely?\\\"<br>\\\"Wouldn\\'t they notice you underneath the balloon?\\\" you asked.<br>\\\"They might or they might not, said Winnie-the.Pooh. \\\"You never can tell with<br>bees.\\\" He thought for a moment and said: \\\"I shall try to look like a small black<br>cloud. That will deceive them.<br>\\\"Then you had better have the blue balloon,\\\" you said; and so it was decided.<br>Well, you both went out with the blue balloon, and you took your gun<br>with you,<br>just in case, as you al.ways did, and Winnie -the-Pooh went to a very muddy<br>place that he knew of, and rolled and rolled until he was black all over;<br>and then, when the balloon was blown up as big as big, and you and Pooh were<br>both holding on to the string, you let go suddenly, and Pooh Bear floated<br>gracefully up into the sky, and stayed there -level with the top of the tree<br>and about twenty feet away from it.<br>\\\"Hooray!\\\" you shouted .<br>\\\"Isn that fine?\\\" shouted Winnie-the-Pooh down to you.<br>\\\"What do I look like?\\\"<br>\\\"You look like a Bear holding on to a balloon,\\\" you said.<br>\\\"Not-\\\" said Pooh anxiously, \\\"-not like a small black cloud in a blue sky?\\\"<br>\\\"Not very much.\\\"<br>\\\"Ah, well, perhaps from up here it looks different. And, as I say, you never<br>can tell with bees.\\\"<br>There was no wind to blow him nearer to the tree, so there he stayed.<br>He could see the honey, he could smell the honey, but he couldn\\'t quite reach<br>After a little while he called down to you.<br>\\\"Christopher Robin!\\\" he said in a loud whisper.<br>\\\"Hallo!\\\"<br>\\\"I think the bees suspect something!\\\"<br>\\\"What sort of thing?\\\"<br>\\\"I don\\'t know. But something tells me that they\\'re suspicious!\\\"<br>\\\"Perhaps they think that you\\'re after their honey.\\\"<br>\\\"It may be that. You never can tell with bees.\\\"<br>There was another little silence, and then he called down to you again.<br>\\\"Christopher Robin!\\\"<br>\\\"Yes?\\\"<br>\\\"Have you an umbrella in your house?\\\"<br>\\\"I think so.\\\"<br>\\\"I wish you would bring it out here, and walk up and down with it, and look up<br>me every now and then, and say \\'Tut-tut, it looks like rain\\'. I think if you<br>did that, it would help the deception which we are practicing on these bees.\\\"<br>\\\"Well, you laughed to yourself\\\", \\\"Silly old Bear!\\\" but you didn\\'t say it aloud<br>because you were so found of him, and you went home for your umbrella.<br>\\\"Oh, there you are!\\\" called down Winnie-the.Pooh, as soon as you got back to<br>the tree.<br>\\\"I was beginning to get anxious. I have discovered that the bees are now<br>definitely Suspicious.\\\"<br>\\\"Shall I put my umbrella up?\\\" you said.<br>\\\"Yes, but wait a moment. We must be practical. The important bee to deceive is<br>the Queen Bee. Can you see which is the Queen Bee from down there?\\\"<br>\\\"No.\\\"<br>\\\"A pity. Well, now, if you walk up and down with your umbrella, saying,<br>\\'Tut-tut, it looks like rain,\\' I shall do what I can by singing a little Cloud<br>Song, such as a cloud might sing .... Go!\\\"<br>\\\"So, while you walked up and down and wondered if it would rain, Winnie-the-Pooh<br>sang this song:<br>How sweet to be a Cloud<br>Floating in the Blue!<br>Every little cloud<br>Always sings aloud.<br>\\\"How sweet to be a Cloud<br>Floating in the Blue!\\\"<br>It makes him very proud<br>To be a little cloud.<br>The bees were still buzzing as suspiciously as ever. Some of them, indeed,<br>left their nest and flew all round the cloud as it began the second verse of<br>this song and one bee sat down on the nose of the cloud<br>for a moment, and then<br>got up again.<br>\\\"Christopher-- ow!-- Robin,\\\" called out the cloud.<br>\\\"Yes?\\\"<br>\\\"I have just been thinking, and I have come to very important decision. These<br>are the wrong sort of bees.\\\"<br>\\\"Are they?\\\"<br>\\\"Quite the wrong sort. So I should think they would make the wrong sort of<br>honey, shouldn\\'t<br>you?\\\"<br>\\\"Would they?\\\"<br>\\\"Yes. So I think I shall come down.\\\"<br>\\\"How?\\\" asked you.<br>Winnie-the-Pooh hadn\\'t thought about this. If he let go of the string, he would<br>fall--bump--and he didn\\'t like the idea of that. So he thought for a long time,<br>and then he said: \\\"Christopher Robin, you must shoot the balloon with your gun.<br>Have you got your gun?\\\"<br>\\\"Of course I have,\\\" you said. \\\"But if I do that, it will spoil the balloon,\\\"<br>you said.<br>\\\"But if you don\\'t,\\\" said Pooh, \\\"I shall have to let go, and that would spoil me.<br>\\\"<br>When you put it like this, you saw how it was, and you aimed very carefully at<br>the balloon, and fired.<br>\\\"Ow!\\\" ad Pooh.<br>\\\"Did I miss?\\\" you asked.<br>\\\"You didn\\'t exactly miss,\\\" said Pooh, \\\"but you missed the balloon.\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'m so sorry\\\" you said, and you fired again, and this time you hit the balloon,<br>and the air came slowly out, and Winnie-the-Pooh floated down to the ground.<br>But his arms were so stiff from holding on to the string of the balloon all that<br>time that they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week, and whenever<br>a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off. And I think--but I am<br>not sure--that that is why he was always called Pooh.<br>\\\"Is that the end of the story?\\\" asked Christopher Robin.<br>\\\"That\\'s the end of that one. There are others.\\\"<br>\\\"About Pooh and me?\\\"<br>\\\"And Piglet and Rabbit and all of you. Don\\'t you remember?\\\"<br>\\\"I do remember, and then when I try to remember , I forget.\\\"<br>\\\"That day when Pooh and Piglet tried to catch the Heffalump --\\\"<br>\\\"They didn\\'t catch it, did they?\\\"<br>\\\"Pooh couldn\\'t, because he hasn\\'t any brain. Did I catch it?\\\"<br>\\\"Well, that comes into the story.\\\"<br>Christopher Robin nodded.<br>\\\"I do remember,\\\" he said, \\\"only Pooh doesn\\'t very well, so that\\'s why he likes<br>having it told to him again. Because then it\\'s a real story and not just a<br>remembering.\\\"<br>\\\"That\\'s just how I feel,\\\" I said.<br>Christopher Robin gave a deep sigh, picked his Bear up by the leg, and walked<br>off to the door, trailing Pooh behind him. At the door he turned and said,<br>\\\"Coming to see me have my bath?\\\"<br>\\\"I might,\\\" I said.<br>\\\"I didn\\'t hurt him when I shot him, did I?\\\"<br>\\\"Not a bit.\\\"<br>He nodded and went out, and in a moment I heard Winnie-the-Pooh--bump, bump,<br>bump-- going up the stairs behind him.\\\"<br>CHAPTER II<br>In Which Pooh Goes Visiting and Gets Into a Tight Place<br>EDWARD BEAR, known to his friends as Winnie-the-Pooh, or Pooh for short, was walking through the forest one day, humming proudly to himself. He had made up a little hum that very morning, as he was doing his Stoutness Exercises in front of the glass: Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, as he stretched up as high as he could go, and then Tra-la-la, tra-la - oh, help! - la, as he tried to reach his toes. After breakfast he had said it over and over to himself until he had learnt it off by heart, and now he was humming it right through, properly. It went like this:<br>Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum, Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle, Tiddle-iddle, tiddle-iddle, Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um.<br>Well, he was humming this hum to himself, and walking along gaily, wondering what everybody else was doing, and what it felt like, being somebody else, when suddenly he came to a sandy bank, and in the bank was a large hole.<br>\\\"Aha!\\\" said Pooh. (Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum.) \\\"If I know anything about anything, that hole means Rabbit,\\\" he said, \\\"and Rabbit means Company,\\\" he said, \\\"and Company means Food and Listening-to-Me Humming and such like. Rum-tum-tum-tiddle-um.\\\"<br>So he bent down, put his head into the hole, and called out: \\\"Is anybody at home?\\\" There was suddenly a scuffling noise from inside the hole, and then silence. \\\"What I said was, \\'Is anybody at home?\\'\\\" called out Pooh very loudly.<br>\\\"No!\\\" said a voice; and then added, \\\"you needn\\'t shout so loud. I heard you quite well the first time.\\\"<br>\\\"Bother!\\\" said Pooh. \\\"Isn\\'t there anybody here at all?\\\"<br>\\\"Nobody.\\\"<br>Winnie-the-Pooh took his head out of the hole, and thought for a little, and he thought to himself, \\\"There must be somebody there, because somebody must have said \\'Nobody.\\'\\\" So he put his head back in the hole, and said: \\\"Hallo, Rabbit, isn\\'t that you?\\\"<br>\\\"No\\\" said Rabbit, in a different sort of voice this time.<br>\\\"But isn\\'t that Rabbit\\'s voice?\\\"<br>\\\"I don\\'t think so,\\\" said Rabbit. \\\"It isn\\'t meant to be.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" said Pooh. He took his head out of the hole, and had another think, and then he put it back, and said: \\\"Well, could you very kindly tell me where Rabbit is?\\\"<br>\\\"He has gone to see his friend Pooh Bear, who is a great friend of his.\\\"<br>\\\"But this is Me!\\\" said Bear, very much surprised.<br>\\\"What sort of Me?\\\"<br>\\\"Pooh Bear.\\\"<br>\\\"Are you sure?\\\" said Rabbit, still more surprised.<br>\\\"Quite, quite sure,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"Oh, well, then, come in.\\\" So Pooh pushed and pushed and pushed his way through the hole, and at last he got in. \\\"You were quite right,\\\" said Rabbit, looking at him all over. \\\"It is you. Glad<br>to see you.\\\"<br>\\\"Who did you think it was?\\\"<br>\\\"Well, I wasn\\'t sure. You know how it is in the Forest. One can\\'t have anybody coming into one\\'s house. One has to be careful. What about a mouthful of something?\\\" Pooh always liked a little something at eleven o\\'clock in the morning, and he was very glad to see Rabbit getting out the plates and mugs; and when Rabbit said, \\\"Honey or condensed milk with your bread?\\\" he was so excited that he said, \\\"Both,\\\" and then, so as not to seem greedy, he added, \\\"but don\\'t bother about the bread, please.\\\" And for a long time after that he said nothing ... until at last, humming to himself in a rather sticky voice, he got up, shook Rabbit lovingly by the paw, and said that he must be going on.<br>\\\"Must you?\\\" said Rabbit politely.<br>\\\"Well,\\\" said Pooh, \\\"I could stay a little longer if it - if you -\\\" and he tried very hard to look in the direction of the larder.<br>\\\"As a matter of fact,\\\" said Rabbit, \\\"I was going out myself directly.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh, well, then, I\\'ll be going on. Good-bye.\\\"<br>\\\"Well, good-bye, if you\\'re sure you won\\'t have anymore.\\\"<br>\\\"Is there any more?\\\" asked Pooh quickly.<br>Rabbit took the covers off the dishes, and said no, there wasn\\'t.<br>\\\"I thought not,\\\" said Pooh, nodding to himself. \\\"Well, good-bye. I must be going on.\\\" So he started to climb out of the hole. He pulled with his front paws, and pushed with his back paws, and in a little while his nose was out in the open again ... and then his ears ... and then his front paws ... and then his shoulders ... and then - \\\"Oh, help!\\\" said Pooh. \\\"I\\'d better go back.\\\" \\\"Oh, bother\\\" said Pooh. \\\"I shall have to go on.\\\" \\\"I can\\'t do either!\\\" said Pooh. \\\"Oh, help and bother!\\\"<br>Now by this time Rabbit wanted to go for a walk too, and finding the front door full, he went out by the back door, and came round to Pooh, and looked at him. \\\"Hallo, are you stuck?\\\" he asked.<br>\\\"N-no,\\\" said Pooh carelessly. \\\"Just resting and thinking and humming to myself.\\\"<br>\\\"Here, give us a paw.\\\"<br>Pooh Bear stretched out a paw, and Rabbit pulled and pulled and pulled... \\\"Ow!\\\" cried Pooh. \\\"You\\'re hurting!\\\"<br>\\\"The fact is,\\\" said Rabbit, \\\"you\\'re stuck.\\\"<br>\\\"It all comes,\\\" said Pooh crossly, \\\"of not having front doors big enough.\\\"<br>\\\"It all comes,\\\" said Rabbit sternly, \\\"of eating too much. I thought at the time,\\\" said Rabbit, \\\"only I didn\\'t like to say anything,\\\" said Rabbit, \\\"that one of us was eating too much,\\\" said Rabbit, \\\"and I knew it wasn\\'t me,\\\" he said. \\\"Well, well, I shall go and fetch Christopher Robin.\\\"<br>Christopher Robin lived at he other end of the Forest, and when he came back with Rabbit, and saw the front half of Pooh, he said, \\\"Silly old Bear,\\\" in such a loving voice that everybody felt quite hopeful again.<br>\\\"I was just beginning to think,\\\" said Bear, sniffing slightly, \\\"that Rabbit might never be able to use his front door again. And I should hate that,\\\" he said.<br>\\\"So should I,\\\" said Rabbit.<br>\\\"Use his front door again?\\\" said Christopher Robin. \\\"Of course he\\'ll use his front door again.\\\"<br>\\\"Good,\\\" said Rabbit.<br>\\\"If we can\\'t pull you out, Pooh, we might push you back.\\\"<br>Rabbit scratched his whiskers thoughtfully, and pointed out that, when once Pooh was pushed back, he was back, and of course nobody was more glad to see Pooh than he was, still there it was, some lived in trees and some lived underground, and -<br>\\\"You mean I\\'d never get out?\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"I mean,\\\" said Rabbit, \\\"that having got so far, it seems a pity to waste it.\\\"<br>Christopher Robin nodded.<br>\\\"There\\'s only one thing to be done,\\\" he said. \\\"We shall have to wait for you to get thin again.\\\"<br>\\\"How long does getting thin take?\\\" asked Pooh anxiously.<br>\\\"About a week, I should think.\\\"<br>\\\"But I can\\'t stay here for a week!\\\"<br>\\\"You can stay here all right, silly old Bear. It\\'s getting you out which is so difficult.\\\"<br>\\\"We\\'ll read to you,\\\" said Rabbit cheerfully. \\\"And I hope it won\\'t snow,\\\" he added. \\\"And I say, old fellow, you\\'re taking up a good deal of room in my house - do you mind if I use your back legs as a towel-horse? Because, I mean, there they are - doing nothing - and it would be very convenient just to hang the towels on them.\\\"<br>\\\"A week!\\\" said Pooh gloomily. \\\"What about meals?\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'m afraid no meals,\\\" said Christopher Robin, \\\"because of getting thin quicker. But we will read to you.\\\"<br>Bear began to sigh, and then found he couldn\\'t because he was so tightly stuck; and a tear rolled down his eye, as he said: \\\"Then would you read a Sustaining Book, such as would help and comfort a Wedged Bear in Great Tightness?\\\"<br>So for a week Christopher Robin read that sort of book at the North end of Pooh, and Rabbit hung his washing on the South end... and in between Bear felt himself getting slenderer and slenderer. And at the end of the week Christopher Robin said, \\\"Now!\\\"<br>So he took hold of Pooh\\'s front paws and Rabbit took hold of Christopher Robin, and all Rabbit\\'s friends and relations took hold of Rabbit, and they all pulled together...<br>And for a long time Pooh only said \\\"Ow!\\\"... And \\\"Oh!\\\"... And then, all of a sudden, he said \\\"Pop!\\\" just as if a cork were coming out of a bottle.<br>And Christopher Robin and Rabbit and all Rabbit\\'s friends and relations went head-over-heels backwards ... and on the top of them came Winnie-the-Pooh - free! So, with a nod of thanks to his friends, he went on with his walk through the forest, humming proudly to himself. But, Christopher Robin looked after him lovingly, and said to himself, \\\"Silly old Bear!\\\"<br>CHAPTER III<br>In Which Pooh and Piglet Go Hunting and Nearly Catch a Woozle<br>THE PIGLET lived in a very grand house in the middle of a a beech-tree, and the beech-tree was in the middle of the forest, and the Piglet lived in the middle of the house. Next to his house was a piece of broken board which had: \\\"TRESPASSERS W\\\" on it. When Christopher Robin asked the Piglet what it meant, he said it was his grandfather\\'s name, and had been in the family for a long time. Christopher Robin said you couldn\\'t be called Trespassers W, and Piglet said yes, you could, because his grandfather was, and it was short for Trespassers Will, which was short for Trespassers William. And his grandfather had had two names in case he lost one - Trespassers after an uncle, and William after Trespassers.<br>\\\"I\\'ve got two names,\\\" said Christopher Robin carelessly.<br>\\\"Well, there you are, that proves it,\\\" said Piglet. One fine winter\\'s day when Piglet was brushing away the snow in front of his house, he happened to look up, and there was Winnie-the-Pooh. Pooh was walking round and round in a circle, thinking of something else, and when Piglet called to him, he just went on walking.<br>\\\"Hallo!\\\" said Piglet, \\\"what are you doing?\\\"<br>\\\"Hunting,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"Hunting what?\\\"<br>\\\"Tracking something,\\\" said Winnie-the-Pooh very mysteriously.<br>\\\"Tracking what?\\\" said Piglet, coming closer.<br>\\\"That\\'s just what I ask myself. I ask myself, What?\\\"<br>\\\"What do you think you\\'ll answer?\\\"<br>\\\"I shall have to wait until I catch up with it,\\\" said Winnie-the-Pooh. \\\"Now, look there.\\\" He pointed to the ground in front of him. \\\"What do you see there?\\\"<br>\\\"Tracks,\\\" said Piglet. \\\"Paw-marks.\\\" He gave a little squeak of excitement. \\\"Oh, Pooh! Do you think it\\'s a - a - a Woozle?\\\"<br>\\\"It may be,\\\" said Pooh. \\\"Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn\\'t. You can never tell with paw-marks.\\\"<br>With these few words he went on tracking, and Piglet, after watching him for a minute or two, ran after him. Winnie-the-Pooh had come to a sudden stop, and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled sort of way.<br>\\\"What\\'s the matter?\\\" asked Piglet.<br>\\\"It\\'s a very funny thing,\\\" said Bear, \\\"but there seem to be two animals now. This - whatever-it-was - has been joined by another - whatever-it-is - and the two of them are now proceeding in company. Would you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case they turn out to be Hostile Animals?\\\"<br>Piglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way, and said that he had nothing to do until Friday, and would be delighted to come, in case it really was a Woozle.<br>\\\"You mean, in case it really is two Woozles,\\\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, and Piglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until Friday. So off they went together.<br>There was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and it seemed as if the two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round this spinney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet after them, Piglet passing the time by telling Pooh what his Grandfather Trespassers W had done to Remove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his Grandfather Trespassers W had suffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath, and other matters of interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was like, and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now, and, if so, whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it, and what Christopher Robin would say. And still the tracks went on in front of them...<br>Suddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped and pointed excitedly in front of him. \\\"Look!\\\"<br>\\\"What?\\\" said Piglet, with a jump. And then, to show that he hadn\\'t been frightened, he jumped up and down once or twice in an exercising sort of way.<br>\\\"The tracks!\\\" said Pooh. \\\"A third animal has joined the other two!\\\"<br>\\\"Pooh!\\\" cried Piglet. \\\"Do you think it is another Woozle?\\\"<br>\\\"No,\\\" said Pooh, \\\"because it makes different marks. It is either Two Woozles and one, as it might be, Wizzle, or Two, as it might be, Wizzles and one, if so it is, Woozle. Let us continue to follow them.\\\"<br>So they went on, feeling just a little anxious now, in case the three animals in front of them were of Hostile Intent. And Piglet wished very much that his Grandfather T. W. were there, instead of elsewhere, and Pooh thought how nice it would be if they met Christopher Robin suddenly but quite accidentally, and only because he liked Christopher Robin so much. And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-the-Pooh stopped again, and licked the tip of his nose in a cooling manner, for he was feeling more hot and anxious than ever in his life before. There were four animals in front of them!<br>\\\"Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three, as it were, Woozles, and one, as it was, Wizzle. Another Woozle has joined them!\\\"<br>And so it seemed to be. There were the tracks; crossing over each other here, getting muddled up with each other there; but, quite plainly every now and then, the tracks of four sets of paws.<br>\\\"I think,\\\" said Piglet, when he had licked the tip of his nose too, and found that it brought very little comfort, \\\"I think that I have just remembered something. I have just remembered something that I forgot to do yesterday and shan\\'t be able to do tomorrow. So I suppose I really ought to go back and do it now.\\\"<br>\\\"We\\'ll do it this afternoon, and I\\'ll come with you,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"It isn\\'t the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon,\\\" said Piglet quickly. \\\"It\\'s a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in the morning, and, if possible, between the hours of - What would you say the time was?\\\"<br>\\\"About twelve,\\\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, looking at the sun.<br>\\\"Between, as I was saying, the hours of twelve and twelve five. So, really, dear old Pooh, if you\\'ll excuse me - What\\'s that?\\\"<br>Pooh looked up at the sky, and then, as he heard the whistle again, he looked up into the branches of a big oak-tree, and then he saw a friend of his.<br>\\\"It\\'s Christopher Robin,\\\" he said.<br>\\\"Ah, then you\\'ll be all right,\\\" said Piglet. \\\"You\\'ll be quite safe with him. Good-bye,\\\" and he trotted off home as quickly as he could, very glad to be Out of All Danger again.<br>Christopher Robin came slowly down his tree.<br>\\\"Silly old Bear,\\\" he said, \\\"what were you doing? First you went round the spinney twice by yourself, and then Piglet ran after you and you went round again together, and then you were just going round a fourth time -\\\"<br>\\\"Wait a moment,\\\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, holding up his paw.<br>He sat down and thought, in the most thoughtful way he could think. Then he fitted his paw into one of the Tracks ... and then he scratched his nose twice, and stood up.<br>\\\"Yes,\\\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.<br>\\\"I see now,\\\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.<br>\\\"I have been Foolish and Deluded,\\\" said he, \\\"and I am a Bear of No Brain at All.\\\"<br>\\\"You\\'re the Best Bear in All the World,\\\" said Christopher Robin soothingly.<br>\\\"Am I?\\\" said Pooh hopefully. And then he brightened up suddenly.<br>\\\"Anyhow,\\\" he said, \\\"it is nearly Luncheon Time.\\\" So he went home for it.<br>CHAPTER IV<br>In Which Eeyore Loses a Tail and Pooh Finds One<br>The old grey donkey, Eeyore, stood by himself in a thistly corner of the forest, his front feet well apart, his head on one side, and thought about things. Sometimes he thought sadly to himself, \\\"Why?\\\" and sometimes he thought, \\\"Wherefore?\\\" and sometimes he thought, \\\"Inasmuch as which?\\\" - and sometimes he didn\\'t quite know what he was thinking about. So when Winnie-the-Pooh came stumping along, Eeyore was very glad to be able to stop thinking for a little, in order to say \\\"How do you do?\\\" in a gloomy manner to him.<br>\\\"And how are you?\\\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.<br>Eeyore shook his head from side to side. \\\"Not very how,\\\" he said. \\\"I don\\'t seem to have felt at all how for a long time.\\\"<br>\\\"Dear, dear,\\\" said Pooh, \\\"I\\'m sorry about that. Let\\'s have a look at you.\\\"<br>So Eeyore stood there, gazing sadly at the ground, and Winnie-the-Pooh walked all round him once. \\\"Why, what\\'s happened to your tail?\\\" he said in surprise.<br>\\\"What has happened to it?\\\" said Eeyore.<br>\\\"It isn\\'t there!\\\"<br>\\\"Are you sure?\\\"<br>\\\"Well, either a tail is there or it isn\\'t there. You can\\'t make a mistake about it. And yours isn\\'t there!\\\"<br>\\\"Then what is?\\\"<br>\\\"Nothing.\\\"<br>\\\"Let\\'s have a look,\\\" said Eeyore, and he turned slowly round to the place where his tail had been a little while ago, and then, finding that he couldn\\'t catch it up, he turned round the other way, until he came back to where he was at first, and then he put his head down and looked between his front legs, and at last he said, with a long, sad sigh, \\\"I believe you\\'re right.\\\"<br>\\\"Of course I\\'m right,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"That Accounts for a Good Deal,\\\" said Eeyore gloomily. \\\"It Explains Everything. No Wonder.\\\"<br>\\\"You must have left it somewhere,\\\" said Winnie-the-Pooh.<br>\\\"Somebody must have taken it,\\\" said Eeyore. \\\"How Like Them,\\\" he added, after a long silence.<br>Pooh felt that he ought to say something helpful about it, but didn\\'t quite know what. So he decided to do something helpful instead.<br>\\\"Eeyore,\\\" he said solemnly, \\\"I, Winnie-the-Pooh, will find your tail for you.\\\"<br>\\\"Thank you, Pooh,\\\" answered Eeyore. \\\"You\\'re a real friend,\\\" said he. \\\"Not like Some,\\\" he said.<br>So Winnie-the-Pooh went off to find Eeyore\\'s tail. It was a fine spring morning in the forest as he started out. Little soft clouds played happily in a blue sky, skipping from time to time in front of the sun as if they had come to put it out, and then sliding away suddenly so that the next might have his turn. Through them and between them the sun shone bravely; and a copse which had worn its firs all the year round seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace which the beeches had put on so prettily. Through copse and spinney marched Bear; down open slopes of gorse and heather, over rocky beds of streams, up steep banks of sandstone into the heather again; and so at last, tired and hungry, to the Hundred Acre Wood. For it was in the Hundred Acre Wood that Owl lived.<br>\\\"And if anyone knows anything about anything,\\\" said Bear to himself, \\\"it\\'s Owl who knows something about something,\\\" he said, \\\"or my name\\'s not Winnie-the-Pooh,\\\" he said. \\\"Which it is,\\\" he added. \\\"So there you are.\\\"<br>Owl lived at The Chestnuts, an old-world residence of great charm, which was grander than anybody else\\'s, or seemed so to Bear, because it had both a knocker and a bell-pull. Underneath the knocker there was a notice which said: PLES RING IF AN RNSER IS REQIRD.<br>Underneath the bell-pull there was a notice which said: PLEZ CNOKE IF AN RNSR IS NOT REQID.<br>These notices had been written by Christopher Robin, who was the only one in the forest who could spell; for Owl, wise though he was in many ways, able to read and write and spell his own name WOL, yet somehow went all to pieces over delicate words like MEASLES and BUTTERED TOAST.<br>Winnie-the-Pooh read the two notices very carefully, first from left to right, and afterwards, in case he had missed some of it, from right to left. Then, to make quite sure, he knocked and pulled the knocker, and he pulled and knocked the bell-rope, and he called out in a very loud voice, \\\"Owl! I require an answer! It\\'s Bear speaking.\\\"\\\" And the door opened, and Owl looked out.<br>\\\"Hallo, Pooh,\\\" he said. \\\"How\\'s things?\\\"<br>\\\"Terrible and Sad,\\\" said Pooh, \\\"because Eeyore, who is a friend of mine, has lost his tail. And he\\'s Moping about it. So could you very kindly tell me how to find it for him?\\\"<br>\\\"Well,\\\" said Owl, \\\"the customary procedure in such cases is as follows.\\\"<br>\\\"What does Crustimoney Proseedcake mean?\\\" said Pooh. \\\"For I am a Bear of Very Little Brain, and long words Bother me.\\\"<br>\\\"It means the Thing to Do.\\\"<br>\\\"As long as it means that, I don\\'t mind,\\\" said Pooh humbly.<br>\\\"The thing to do is as follows. First, Issue a Reward. Then -\\\"<br>\\\"Just a moment,\\\" said Pooh, holding up his paw.<br>\\\"What do we do to this - what you were saying? You sneezed just as you were going to tell me.\\\"<br>\\\"I didn\\'t sneeze.\\\"<br>\\\"Yes, you did, Owl.\\\"<br>\\\"Excuse me, Pooh, I didn\\'t. You can\\'t sneeze without knowing it.\\\"<br>\\\"Well, you can\\'t know it without something having been sneezed.\\\"<br>\\\"What I said was, \\'First Issue a Reward.\\'\\\"<br>\\\"You\\'re doing it again,\\\" said Pooh sadly.<br>\\\"A Reward!\\\" said Owl very loudly. \\\"We write a notice to say that we will give a large something to anybody who finds Eeyore\\'s tail.\\\"<br>\\\"I see, I see,\\\" said Pooh, nodding his head. \\\"Talking about large somethings,\\\" he went on dreamily, \\\"I generally have a small something about now - about this time in the morning,\\\" and he looked wistfully at the cupboard in the corner of Owl\\'s parlour; \\\"just a mouthful of condensed milk or what not, with perhaps a lick of honey -\\\"<br>\\\"Well, then,\\\" said Owl, \\\"we write out this notice, and we put it up all over the forest.\\\"<br>\\\"A lick of honey,\\\" murmured Bear to himself, \\\"or - or not, as the case may be.\\\" And he gave a deep sigh, and tried very hard to listen to what Owl was saying.<br>But Owl went on and on, using longer and longer words, until at last he came back to where he started, and he explained that the person to write out this notice was Christopher Robin.<br>\\\"It was he who wrote the ones on my front door for me. Did you see them, Pooh?\\\"<br>For some time now Pooh had been saying \\\"Yes\\\" and \\\"No\\\" in turn, with his eyes shut, to all that Owl was saying, and having said, \\\"Yes, yes,\\\" last time, he said \\\"No, not at all,\\\" now, without really knowing what Owl was talking about.<br>\\\"Didn\\'t you see them?\\\" said Owl, a little surprised. \\\"Come and look at them now.\\\"<br>So they went outside. And Pooh looked at the knocker and the notice below it, and he looked at the bell-rope and the notice below it, and the more he looked at the bell-rope, the more he felt that he had seen something like it, somewhere else, sometime before.<br>\\\"Handsome bell-rope, isn\\'t it?\\\" said Owl.<br>Pooh nodded.<br>\\\"It reminds me of something,\\\" he said, \\\"but I can\\'t think what. Where did you get it?\\\"<br>\\\"I just came across it in the Forest. It was hanging over a bush, and I thought at first somebody lived there, so I rang it, and nothing happened, and then I rang it again very loudly, and it came off in my hand, and as nobody seemed to want it, I took it home, and -\\\"<br>\\\"Owl,\\\" said Pooh solemnly, \\\"you made a mistake. Somebody did want it.\\\"<br>\\\"Who?\\\"<br>\\\"Eeyore. My dear friend Eeyore. He was - he was fond of it.\\\"<br>\\\"Fond of it?\\\"<br>\\\"Attached to it,\\\" said Winnie-the-Pooh sadly.<br>So with these words he unhooked it, and carried it back to Eeyore; and when Christopher Robin had nailed it on in its right place again, Eeyore frisked about the forest, waving his tail so happily that Winnie-the-Pooh came over all funny, and had to hurry home for a little snack of something to sustain him. And, wiping his mouth half an hour afterwards, he sang to himself proudly:<br>Who found the Tail?<br>\\\"I,\\\" said Pooh, \\\"At a quarter to two<br>(Only it was quarter to eleven really),<br>I found the Tail!\\\"<br>CHAPTER V<br>In Which<br>Piglet Meets a Heffalump<br>ONE DAY, when Christopher Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet were all talking together, Christopher Robin finished the mouthful he was eating and said carelessly: \\\"I saw a Heffalump to-day, Piglet.\\\"<br>\\\"What was it doing?\\\" asked Piglet.<br>\\\"Just lumping along,\\\" said Christopher Robin. \\\"I don\\'t think it saw me.\\\"<br>\\\"I saw one once,\\\" said Piglet. \\\"At least, I think I did,\\\" he said. \\\"Only perhaps it wasn\\'t.\\\"<br>\\\"So did I,\\\" said Pooh, wondering what a Heffalump was like.<br>\\\"You don\\'t often see them,\\\" said Christopher Robin carelessly.<br>\\\"Not now,\\\" said Piglet.<br>\\\"Not at this time of year,\\\" said Pooh.<br>Then they all talked about something else, until it was time for Pooh and Piglet to go home together. At first as they stumped along the path which edged the Hundred Acre Wood, they didn\\'t say much to each other\\' but when they came to the stream and had helped each other across the stepping stones, and were able to walk side by side again over the heather, they began to talk in a friendly way about this and that, and Piglet said,<br>\\\"If you see what I mean, Pooh,\\\" and Pooh said,<br>\\\"It\\'s just what I think myself, Piglet,\\\" and Piglet said,<br>\\\"But, on the other hand, Pooh, we must remember,\\\" and Pooh said<br>\\\"Quite true, Piglet, although I had forgotten it for the moment.\\\"<br>And then, just as they came to the Six Pine Trees, Pooh looked round to see that nobody else was listening, and said in a very solemn voice:<br>\\\"Piglet, I have decided something.\\\"<br>\\\"What have you decided, Pooh?\\\"<br>\\\"I have decided to catch a Heffalump.\\\"<br>Pooh nodded his head several times as he said this, and waited for Piglet to say \\\"How?\\\" or \\\"Pooh, you couldn\\'t\\\" or something helpful of that sort, but Piglet said nothing. The fact was Piglet was wishing that he had thought about it first.<br>\\\"I shall do it,\\\" said Pooh, after waiting a little longer, \\\"by means of a trap. And it must be a Cunning Trap, so you will have to help me, Piglet.\\\"<br>\\\"Pooh,\\\" said Piglet, feeling quite happy again now, \\\"I will.\\\"<br>And then he said, \\\"How shall we do it?\\\"<br>And Pooh said, \\\"That\\'s just it. How?\\\"<br>And then they sat down together to think it out.<br>Pooh\\'s first idea was that they should dig a Very Deep Pit, and then the Heffalump would come along and fall into the Pit, and-<br>\\\"Why?\\\" said Piglet.<br>\\\"Why what?\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"Why would he fall in?\\\"<br>Pooh rubbed his nose with his paw, and said that the Heffalump might be walking along, humming a little song, and looking up at the sky, wondering if it would rain, and so he wouldn\\'t see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way down, when it would be too late.<br>Piglet said that this was a very good Trap, but supposing it were raining already?<br>Pooh rubbed his nose again, and said that he hadn\\'t thought of that. And then he brightened up, and said that, if it were raining already, the Heffalump would be looking at the sky wondering if it would clear up, and so he wouldn\\'t see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way down...¦. When it would be too late.<br>Piglet said that, now that this point had been explained, he thought it was a Cunning Trap.<br>Pooh was very proud when he heard this, and he felt that the Heffalump was as good as caught already, but there was just one other thing which had to be thought about, and it was this. Where should they dig the Very Deep Pit?<br>Piglet said that the best place would be somewhere where a Heffalump was, just before he fell into it, only about a foot farther on.<br>\\\"But then he would see us digging it,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"Not if he was looking at the sky.\\\"<br>\\\"He would suspect,\\\" said Pooh, \\\"if he happened to look down.\\\"<br>He thought for a long time and then added sadly, \\\"It isn\\'t as easy as I thought. I suppose that\\'s why Heffalumps hardly ever get caught.\\\"<br>\\\"That must be it,\\\" said Piglet.<br>They sighed and got up; and when they had taken a few gorse prickles out of themselves they sat down again\\' and all the time Pooh was saying to himself, \\\"If only I could think of something!\\\"<br>For he felt sure that a Very Clever Brain could catch a Heffalump if only he knew the right way to go about it.<br>\\\"Suppose,\\\" he said to Piglet, \\\"you wanted to catch me, how would you do it?\\\"<br>\\\"Well,\\\" said Piglet, \\\"I should do it like this. I should make a Trap, and I should put a Jar of Honey in the Trap, and you would smell it, and you would go in after it, and-\\\"<br>\\\"And I would go in after it,\\\" said Pooh excitedly, \\\"only very carefully so as not to hurt myself, and I would get to the Jar of Honey, and I should lick round the edges first of all, pretending that there wasn\\'t any more, you know, and then I should walk away and think about it a little, and then I should come back and start licking in the middle of the jar, and then-\\\"<br>\\\"Yes, well never mind about that. There you would be, and there I should catch you. Now the first thing to think of is, What do Heffalumps like? I should think acorns, shouldn\\'t you? We\\'ll get a lot of-I say, wake up, Pooh!\\\"<br>Pooh, who had gone into a happy dream, woke up with a start, and said that Honey was a much more trappy thing than Haycorns. Piglet didn\\'t think so; and they were just going to argue about it, when Piglet remembered that, if they put acorns in the Trap, he would have to find the acorns, but if they put honey, then Pooh would have to give up some of his own honey, so he said, \\\"All right, honey then,\\\" just as Pooh remembered it too, and was going to say, \\\"All right, haycorns.\\\"<br>\\\"Honey,\\\" said Piglet to himself in a thoughtful way, as if it were now settled.<br>\\\"I\\'ll dig the pit, while you go and get the honey.\\\"<br>\\\"Very well,\\\" said Pooh, and he stumped off.<br>As soon as he got home, he went to the larder; and he stood on a chair, and took down a very large jar of honey from the top shelf. It had HUNNY written on it, but, just to make sure, he took off the paper cover and looked at it, and it looked just like honey.<br>\\\"But you never can tell,\\\" said Pooh. \\\"I remember my uncle saying once that he had seen cheese just this colour.\\\"<br>So he put his tongue in, and took a large lick.<br>\\\"Yes,\\\" he said, \\\"it is. No doubt about that. And honey, I should say, right down to the bottom of the jar. Unless, of course,\\\" he said \\\"somebody put cheese in at the bottom just for a joke. Perhaps I had better go a little further...¦ just in case...¦ in case Heffalumps don\\'t like cheese...¦ same as me...¦Ah!\\\" And he gave a deep sigh. \\\"I was right. It is honey, right the way down.\\\"<br>Having made certain of this, he took the jar back to Piglet, and Piglet looked up from the bottom of his Very Deep Pit, and said \\\"Got it?\\\"<br>and Pooh said, \\\"Yes, but it isn\\'t quite a full jar,\\\" and he threw it down to Piglet, and Piglet said<br>\\\"No, it isn\\'t! Is that all you\\'ve got left?\\\" and Pooh said<br>\\\"Yes.\\\"<br>Because it was. So Piglet put the jar at the bottom of the Pit, and climbed out, and they went off home together.<br>\\\"Well, good night, Pooh,\\\" said Piglet, when they had got to Pooh\\'s house. \\\"And we meet at six o\\'clock tomorrow morning by the Pine Trees, and see how many Heffalumps we\\'ve got in out Trap.\\\"<br>\\\"Six o\\'clock, Piglet. And have you got any string?\\\"<br>\\\"No. Why do you want string?\\\"<br>\\\"To lead them home with.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh!... I think Heffalumps come if you whistle.\\\"<br>\\\"Some do and some don\\'t. You never can tell with Heffalumps. Well, good night!\\\"<br>\\\"Good night!\\\"<br>And off Piglet trotted to his house, TRESPASSERS W, while Pooh made his preparations for bed.<br>Some hours later, just as the night was beginning to steal away, Pooh woke up suddenly with a sinking feeling. He had had that sinking feeling before, and he knew what it meant. He was hungry. So he went to the larder, and he stood on a chair and reached up to the top shelf, and found-nothing.<br>\\\"That\\'s funny,\\\" he thought. \\\"I know I had a jar of honey there. A full jar, full of honey right up to the top, and it had HUNNY written on it, so that I should know it was honey. That\\'s very funny.\\\" And then he began to wander up and down, wondering where it was and murmuring a murmur to himself.<br>Like this:<br>It\\'s very, very funny,<br>\\'Cos I know I had some honey;<br>\\'Cos it had a label on,<br>Saying HUNNY.<br>A goloptious full-up pot too,<br>And I don\\'t know where it\\'s gone to,<br>No I don\\'t know where it\\'s gone-<br>Well, it\\'s funny.<br>He had murmured this to himself three times in a singing sort of way, when suddenly he remembered. He had put it into the Cunning Trap to catch the Heffalump.<br>\\\"Bother!\\\" said Pooh. \\\"It all comes of trying to be kind to Heffalumps.\\\" And he got back into bed.<br>But he couldn\\'t sleep. The more he tried to sleep, the more he couldn\\'t He tried Counting Sheep, which is sometimes a good way of getting to sleep, and, as that was no good, he tried counting Heffalumps. And that was worse. Because every Heffalump that he counted was making straight for a pot of Pooh\\'s honey, and eating it all. For some minutes he lay there miserably, but when the five hundred and eighty-seventh Heffalump was licking its jaws, and saying to itself, \\\"Very good honey this, I don\\'t know when I\\'ve tasted better,\\\" Pooh could bear it no longer. He jumped out of bed, he ran out of the house, and he ran straight to the Six Pine Trees.<br>The Sun was still in bed, but there was a lightness in the sky over the Hundred Acre Wood which seemed to show that it was waking up and would soon be kicking off the clothes. In the half-light the Pine Trees looked cold and lonely, and the Very Deep Pit seemed deeper than it was, and Pooh\\'s jar of honey at the bottom was something mysterious, a shape and no more. But as he got nearer to it his nose told him that it was indeed honey, and his tongue came out and began to polish up his mouth, ready for it.<br>\\\"Bother!\\\" said Pooh, as he got his nose inside the jar. \\\"A Heffalump has been eating it!\\\" And then he thought a little and said, \\\"Oh, no, I did. I forgot.\\\"<br>Indeed, he had eaten most of it. But there was a little left at the very bottom of the jar, and he pushed his head right in, and began to lick...¦.<br>By and by Piglet woke up. As soon as he woke up he said to himself, \\\"Oh!\\\" Then he said bravely, \\\"Yes,\\\" and then, still more bravely, \\\"Quite so.\\\" But he didn\\'t feel very brave at all, for the word which was really jiggeting about in his brain was \\\"Heffalumps.\\\"<br>What was a Heffalump like?<br>Was it fierce?<br>Did it come when you whistled? And how did it come?<br>Was it Fond of Pigs at all?<br>If it was Fond of Pigs, did it make any difference what sort of Pig?<br>Supposing it was Fierce with Pigs, would it make any difference if the Pig had a grandfather called TRESPASSERS WILLIAM?<br>He didn\\'t know the answer to any of these questions...¦ and he was going to see his first Heffalump in about an hour from now!<br>Of course Pooh would be with him, and it was much more Friendly with two. But suppose Heffalumps were Very Fierce with Pigs and Bears? Wouldn\\'t it be better to pretend that he had a headache, and couldn\\'t go up to the Six Pine Trees this morning? But then suppose that it was a very fine day, and there was no Heffalump in the trap, here he would be, in bed all the morning, simply wasting his time for nothing. What should he do?<br>And then he had a Clever Idea. He would go up very quietly to the Six Pine Trees now, peep very cautiously into the Trap, and see if there was a Heffalump there. And if there was, he would go back to bed, and if there wasn\\'t, he wouldn\\'t.<br>So off he went. At first he thought that there wouldn\\'t be a Heffalump in the Trap, and then he thought that there would, because he could hear it heffalumping about it like anything.<br>\\\"Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!\\\" said Piglet to himself. And he wanted to run away. But somehow, having got so near, he felt that he must just see what a Heffalump was like. So he crept to the side of the Trap and looked in...¦.<br>And all the time Winnie-the-Pooh had been trying to get the honey-jar off his head. The more he shook it, the more tightly it stuck. \\\"Bother!\\\" he said inside the jar, and \\\"Oh, help!\\\" and, mostly \\\"Ow!\\\" And he tried bumping it against things, but as he couldn\\'t see what he was bumping it against, it didn\\'t help him; and he tried to climb out of the Trap, but as he could see nothing but jar, and not much of that, he couldn\\'t find his way. So at last he lifted up his head, jar and all, and made a loud, roaring noise of Sadness and Despair...¦ and it was at that moment that Piglet looked down.<br>\\\"Help, help!\\\" cried Piglet, \\\"a Heffalump, a Horrible Heffalump!\\\" and he scampered off as hard as he could, still crying out, \\\"Help, help, a Herrible Hoffalump! Hoff, Hoff, a Hellible Horralump! Holl, Holl, a Hoffable Hellerump!\\\" And he didn\\'t stop crying and scampering until he got to Christopher Robin\\'s house.<br>\\\"Whatever\\'s the matter, Piglet?\\\" said Christopher Robin, who was just getting up.<br>\\\"Heff,\\\" said Piglet, breathing so hard that he could hardly speak, \\\"a Hell- a Heff- a Heffalump.\\\"<br>\\\"Where?\\\"<br>\\\"Up there,\\\" said Piglet, waving his paw.<br>\\\"What did it look like?\\\"<br>\\\"Like- like- It had the biggest head you ever saw, Christopher Robin. A great enormous thing, like- like nothing. A huge big- well, like a- I don\\'t know- like an enormous big nothing. Like a jar.\\\"<br>\\\"Well,\\\" said Christopher Robin, putting on his shoes, \\\"I shall go and look at it. Come on.\\\"<br>Piglet wasn\\'t afraid if he had Christopher Robin with him, so off they went...¦.<br>\\\"I can hear it, can\\'t you?\\\" said Piglet anxiously, as they got near.<br>\\\"I can hear something,\\\" said Christopher Robin.<br>It was Pooh bumping his head against a tree-root he had found.<br>\\\"There!\\\" said Piglet. \\\"Isn\\'t it awful?\\\" And he held on tight to Christopher Robin\\' hand.<br>Suddenly Christopher Robin began to laugh...¦ and he laughed...¦ and he laughed...¦ and he laughed. And while he was still laughing- Crash went the Heffalump\\'s head against the tree-root, Smash went the jar, and out came Pooh\\'s head again...¦.<br>Then Piglet saw what a Foolish Piglet he had been, and he was so ashamed of himself that he ran straight off home and went to bed with a headache. But Christopher Robin and Pooh went home to breakfast together.<br>\\\"Oh, Bear!\\\" said Christopher Robin. \\\"How I do love you!\\\"<br>\\\"So do I,\\\" said Pooh.<br>CHAPTER VI<br>In which<br>Eeyore Has a Birthday and Gets Two Presents<br>EYORE, the old grey Donkey, stood by the side of<br>the stream, and looked at himself in the water.<br>\\\"Pathetic ,\\\" he said. \\\"That\\'s what it is. Pathetic.\\\"<br>H<br>e turned and walked slowly down the stream for twenty yards, splashed across it,<br>and walked slowly back on the other side. Then he looked at himself in<br>the water again.<br>\\\"As I thought,\\\" he said. \\\"No better from this side.<br>But nobody minds. Nobody cares. Pathetic, that\\'s<br>what it is.\\\" There was a crackling noise in the bracken behind<br>him, and out came Pooh. \\\"Good morning, Eeyore,\\\" said Pooh.<br>Good morning, Pooh Bear,\\\" said Eeyore gloomily. \\\"If it is a good morning,\\\" he said. \\\"Which I<br>doubt,\\\" said he.<br>\\\"Why, what\\'s the matter?\\\"<br>\\\"Nothing, Pooh Bear, nothing. We can\\'t all, and<br>some of us don\\'t. That\\'s all there is to it.\\\"<br>\\\"Can\\'t all what?\\\" said Pooh, rubbing his nose.<br>\\\"<br>Gaiety. Song-and-dance . Here we go round the<br>mulberry bush.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" said Pooh. He thought for a long time, and<br>then asked, \\\"What mulberry bush is that?\\\"<br>\\\"<br>Bon-hommy,\\\" went on Eeyore gloomily. \\\"French<br>word meaning bonhommy,\\\" he explained. \\\"I\\'m not<br>complaining, but There It Is.\\\"<br>Pooh sat down on a large stone, and tried to think<br>this out. It sounded to him like a riddle, and he was<br>never much good at riddles, being a Bear of Very<br>Little Brain . So he sang Cottleston Pie instead:<br>Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,<br>A fly can\\'t bird, but a bird can fly.<br>Ask me a riddle and I reply:<br>Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie.\\\"<br>That was the first verse. When he had finished it,<br>Eeyore didn\\'t actually say that he didn\\'t like it, so<br>Pooh very kindly sang the second verse to him:<br>Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,<br>A fish can\\'t whistle and neither can I.<br>Ask me a riddle and I reply:<br>\\\"Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie.\\\"<br>Eeyore still said nothing at all, so Pooh hummed<br>the third verse quietly to himself:<br>Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie,<br>Why does a chicken, I don\\'t know why.<br>Ask me a riddle and I reply:<br>\\\"Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie.\\\"<br>\\\"That\\'s right,\\\" said Eeyore. \\\"Sing. Umty -tiddly,<br>umty -too. Here we go gathering Nuts and May.<br>Enjoy yourself.\\\"<br>\\\"I am,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"Some can,\\\" said Eeyore.<br>\\\"Why, what\\'s the matter?\\\"<br>\\\"Is anything the matter?\\\"<br>\\\"You seem so sad, Eeyore.\\\"<br>\\\"<br>Sad? Why should I be sad? It\\'s my birthday. The<br>happiest day of the year.\\\"<br>\\\"Your birthday?\\\" said Pooh in great surprise.<br>\\\"Of course it is. Can\\'t you see? Look at all the<br>presents I have had.\\\" He waved a foot from side to<br>side. \\\"Look at the birthday cake. Candles and pink<br>sugar.\\\"<br>Pooh looked- first to the right and then to the<br>left.<br>\\\"Presents?\\\" said Pooh. \\\"Birthday cake?\\\" said<br>Pooh. \\\"Where?\\\"<br>\\\"Can\\'t you see them?\\\"<br>\\\"<br>No,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"Neither can I,\\\" said Eeyore. \\\"Joke,\\\" he explained. \\\"Ha ha!\\\"<br>Pooh scratched his head, being a little puzzled by all this.<br>\\\"But is it really your birthday?\\\" he asked.<br>\\\"It is.\\\"<br>\\\"<br>Oh! Well, Many happy returns of the day,<br>Eeyore.\\\"<br>\\\"And many happy returns to you, Pooh Bear.\\\"<br>\\\"<br>But it isn\\'t my birthday.\\\"<br>\\\"No, it\\'s mine.\\\"<br>\\\"<br>But you said \\'Many happy returns\\'--\\\"<br>\\\"Well why not? You don\\'t always want to be<br>miserable on my birthday, do you?\\\"<br>\\\"Oh, I see\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"It\\'s bad enough, said Eeyore, almost breaking<br>down, \\\"being miserable myself, what with no pres-<br>ents and no cake and no candles, and no proper no-<br>tice taken of me at all, but if everybody else is going<br>to be miserable too --<br>This was too much for Pooh. \\\"Stay there!\\\" he<br>called to Eeyore, as he turned and hurried back home<br>as quick as he could; for he felt that he must get poor<br>Eeyore a present of some sort at once, and he could<br>always think of a proper one afterwards.<br>Outside his house he found Piglet, jumping up and<br>down trying to reach the knocker.<br>\\\"Hallo, Piglet,\\\" he said.<br>\\\"Hallo, Pooh,\\\" said Piglet.<br>\\\"What are you trying to do?\\\"<br>\\\"I was trying to reach the knocker,\\\" said Piglet. \\\"I<br>just came round --\\\"<br>\\\"Let me do it for you,\\\" said Pooh kindly. So he<br>reached up and knocked at the door. \\\"I have just seen<br>Eeyore,\\\" he began, \\\"and poor Eeyore is in a Very<br>Sad Condition, because it\\'s his birthday, and nobody<br>has taken any notice of it, and he\\'s very Gloomy-<br>you know what Eeyore is- and there he was, and<br>--What a long time whoever lives here is answer-<br>ing this door.\\\" And he knocked again.<br>\\\"But Pooh,\\\" said Piglet, \\\"it\\'s your own house!\\\"<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" said Pooh. \\\"So it is,\\\" he said. \\\"Well, let\\'s<br>go in.\\\"<br>So in they went. The first thing Pooh did was to go<br>to the cupboard to see if he had quite a small jar of<br>honey left; and he had, so he took it down.<br>\\\"I\\'m giving this to Eeyore,\\\" he explained, \\\"as a<br>present. What are you going to give?\\\"<br>\\\"Couldn\\'t I give it too?\\\" said Piglet. \\\"From both<br>of us?\\\"<br>\\\"No,\\\" said Pooh, \\\"That would not be a good<br>plan.\\\"<br>\\\"All right, then, I\\'ll give him a balloon. I\\'ve got<br>one left from my party. I\\'ll go and get it now<br>shall I?\\\"<br>\\\"That, Piglet, is a very good idea. It is just what<br>Eeyore wants to cheer him up. Nobody can be un-<br>cheered with a balloon.\\\"<br>So off Piglet trotted; and in the other direction<br>went Pooh, with his jar of honey.<br>It was a warm day, and he had a long way to go.<br>He hadn\\'t gone more than half-way when a sort of<br>funny feeling began to creep all over him. It began<br>at the tip of his nose and trickled all through him<br>and out at the soles of his feet. It was just as if somebody inside him were saying, \\\"Now then, Pooh, time<br>for a little something.\\\"<br>\\\"Dear, dear,\\\" said Pooh, \\\"I didn\\'t know it was as<br>late as that.\\\" So he sat down and took the top off his<br>jar of honey. \\\"Lucky I brought this with me,\\\" he<br>thought. \\\"Many a bear going out on a warm day like<br>this would never have thought of bringing a little<br>something with him.\\\" And he began to eat.<br>\\\"Now let me see,\\\" he thought, as he took his last<br>lick of the inside of the jar, \\\"where was I going? Ah,<br>yes, Eeyore.\\\" He got up slowly.<br>And then, suddenly, he remembered. He had<br>eaten Eeyore\\'s birthday present!<br>\\\"Bother!\\\" said Pooh. \\\"What shall I do? I must give<br>him something.\\\"<br>For a little while he couldn\\'t think of anything.<br>Then he thought: \\\"Well, it\\'s a very nice pot, even if<br>there\\'s no honey in it, and if I washed it clean, and<br>got somebody to write \\'A Happy Birthday\\' on it,<br>Eeyore could keep things in it, which might be Useful.\\\" So, as he was just passing the Hundred Acre<br>Wood, he went inside to call on Owl, who lived there.<br>\\\"Good morning, Owl,\\\" he said.<br>\\\"Good morning, Pooh,\\\" said Owl.<br>\\\"Many happy returns of Eeyore\\'s birthday,\\\" said<br>Pooh.<br>\\\"Oh, is that what it is?\\\"<br>\\\"What are you giving him, Owl?\\\"<br>\\\"What are you giving him, Pooh?\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'m giving him a Useful Pot to Keep Things In,<br>and I wanted to ask you --<br>\\\"<br>Is this it?\\\" said Owl, taking it out of Pooh\\'s paw.<br>\\\"Yes, and I wanted to ask you--\\\"<br>\\\"Somebody has been keeping honey in it,\\\" said<br>Owl.<br>\\\"You can keep anything in it,\\\" said Pooh earnestly.<br>\\\"It\\'s Very Useful like that. And I wanted to ask<br>you--\\\"<br>\\\"You ought to write \\'A Happy Birthday\\' on it.\\\"<br>That was what I wanted to ask you,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"Because my spelling is Wobbly. It\\'s good spelling<br>but it Wobbles, and the letters get in the wrong<br>places. Would you write \\'A Happy Birthday\\' on it for<br>me?\\\"<br>\\\"It\\'s a nice pot,\\\" said Owl, looking at it all round.<br>Could\\'t I give it too? From both of us?\\\"<br>\\\"No,\\\" said Pooh. \\\"That would not be a good plan.<br>Now I\\'ll just wash it first, and then you can write on<br>it.\\\"<br>Well, he washed the pot out, and dried it, while<br>Owl licked the end of his pencil, and wondered how<br>to spell \\\"birthday.\\\"<br>\\\"Can you read, Pooh?\\\" he asked, a little anxiously.<br>\\\"There\\'s a notice about knocking and ringing outside<br>my door, which Christopher Robin wrote. Could you<br>read it?\\\"<br>\\\"Christopher Robin told me what it said, and then<br>I could.\\\"<br>\\\"<br>Well, I\\'ll tell you what this says, and then you\\'ll<br>be able to.\\\"<br>So Owl wrote... and this is what he wrote:<br>HIPY PAPY BTHUTHDTH THUTHDA BTHUTHDY.<br>Pooh looked on admiringly.<br>\\\"I\\'m just saying \\'A Happy Birthday,\\'\\\" said Owl<br>carelessly.<br>\\\"It\\'s a nice long one,\\\" said Pooh, very much impressed by it. \\\"Well, actually, of course, I\\'m saying \\'A Very<br>Happy Birthday with love from Pooh.\\' Naturally it<br>takes a good deal of pencil to say a long thing like that.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh, I see,\\\" said Pooh.<br>While all this was happening, Piglet had gone back<br>to his own house to get Eeyore\\'s balloon. He held it<br>very tightly against himself, so that it shouldn\\'t blow<br>away, and he ran as fast as he could so as to get to<br>Eeyore before Pooh did; for he thought that he<br>would like to be the first one to give a present, just<br>as if he had thought of it without being told by any-<br>body. And running along, and thinking how pleased<br>Eeyore would be, he didn\\'t look where he was<br>going ... and suddenly he put his foot in a rabbit<br>hole, and fell down flat on his face.<br>BANG!!!???***!!!<br>Piglet lay there, wondering what had happened. At<br>first he thought that the whole world had blown up;<br>and then he thought that perhaps only the Forest part<br>of it had; and then he thought that perhaps only he<br>had, and he was now alone in the moon or some-<br>where, and would never see Christopher Robin or<br>Pooh or Eeyore again. And then he thought, \\\"Well,<br>even if I\\'m in the moon, I needn\\'t be face downwards all the time,\\\" so he got cautiously up and<br>looked about him.<br>He was still in the Forest!<br>\\\"Well, that\\'s funny,\\\" he thought. \\\"I wonder what<br>that bang was. I couldn\\'t have made such a noise just<br>falling down. And where\\'s my balloon? And what\\'s<br>that small piece of damp rag doing?\\\"<br>It was the balloon!<br>\\\"Oh dear!\\\" said Piglet. \\\"Oh, dear, oh, dearie,<br>dearie, dear! Well, it\\'s too late now. I can\\'t go back,<br>and I haven\\'t another balloon, and perhaps Eeyore<br>doesn\\'t like balloons so very much.\\\"<br>So he trotted on, rather sadly now, and down he<br>came to the side of the stream where Eeyore was, and<br>called out to him.<br>\\\"Good morning, Eeyore,\\\" shouted Piglet.<br>\\\"Good morning, Little Piglet,\\\" said Eeyore. \\\"If it<br>is a good morning,\\\" he said. \\\"Which I doubt,\\\" said<br>he. \\\"Not that it matters,\\\" he said.<br>\\\"Many happy returns of the day,\\\" said Piglet, having now got closer.<br>Eeyore stopped looking at himself in the stream,<br>and turned to stare at Piglet.<br>\\\"Just say that again,\\\" he said.<br>\\\"Many hap--\\\"<br>\\\"<br>Wait a moment.\\\"<br>Balancing on three legs, he began to bring his<br>fourth leg very cautiously up to his ear. \\\"I did this<br>yesterday, \\\" he explained, as he fell down for the third<br>time. \\\"It\\'s quite easy. It\\'s so as I can hear better.<br>...There, that\\'s done it! Now then, what were you<br>saying?\\\" He pushed his ear forward with his hoof.<br>\\\"Many happy returns of the day,\\\" said Piglet again.<br>\\\"Meaning me?\\\"<br>\\\"Of course, Eeyore.\\\"<br>\\\"My birthday?\\\"<br>\\\"Yes.\\\"<br>\\\"Me having a real birthday?\\\"<br>\\\"Yes, Eeyore, and I\\'ve brought you a present.\\\"<br>Eeyore took down his right hoof from his right ear,<br>turned round, and with great difficulty put up his left<br>hoof.<br>\\\"I must have that in the other ear,\\\" he said. \\\"Now<br>then.\\\"<br>\\\"A present,\\\" said Piglet very loudly.<br>\\\"Meaning me again?\\\"<br>\\\"Yes.\\\"<br>\\\"My birthday still?\\\"<br>\\\"Of course, Eeyore.\\\"<br>\\\"Me going on having a real birthday?\\\"<br>\\\"Yes, Eeyore, and I brought you a balloon.\\\"<br>\\\"Balloon?\\\" said Eeyore. \\\"You did say balloon?<br>One of those big coloured things you blow up? Gaiety, song-and-dance, here we are and there we are?\\\"<br>\\\"<br>Yes, but I\\'m afraid- I\\'m very sorry, Eeyore-<br>but when I was running along to bring it you, I fell<br>down.\\\"<br>\\\"Dear, dear, how unlucky! You ran too fast, I ex-<br>pect. You didn\\'t hurt yourself, Little Piglet?\\\"<br>\\\"<br>No, but I-I-oh, Eeyore, I burst the balloon!\\\"<br>There was a very long silence.<br>My balloon? said Eeyore at last.<br>Piglet nodded.<br>\\\"My birthday balloon?\\\"<br>\\\"Yes, Eeyore,\\\" said Piglet sniffing a little. \\\"Here it<br>is. With- with many happy returns of the day.\\\" And<br>he gave Eeyore the small piece of damp rag.<br>\\\"Is this it?\\\" said Eeyore, a little surprised.<br>Piglet nodded .<br>\\\"My present?\\\"<br>Piglet nodded again.<br>\\\"The balloon?\\\"<br>\\\"Yes.\\\"<br>\\\"Thank you, Piglet,\\\" said Eeyore. \\\"You don\\'t<br>mind my asking,\\\" he went on, \\\"but what colour was<br>this balloon when it- when it was a balloon?\\\"<br>\\\"Red.\\\"<br>\\\"I just wondered.... Red,\\\" he murmured to him-<br>self. \\\"My favourite colour . . .. How big was it?\\\"<br>\\\"About as big as me.\\\"<br>\\\"I just wondered .... About as big as Piglet,\\\" he<br>said to himself sadly. \\\"My favourite size. Well, well.\\\"<br>Piglet felt very miserable, and didn\\'t know what to<br>say. He was still opening his mouth to begin some-<br>thing, and then deciding that it wasn\\'t any good say-<br>ing that, when he heard a shout from the other side of<br>the river, and there was Pooh.<br>\\\"Many happy returns of the day,\\\" called out Pooh,<br>forgetting that he had said it already.<br>\\\"Thank you, Pooh, I\\'m having them,\\\" said Eeyore<br>gloomily.<br>\\\"I\\'ve brought you a little present,\\\" said Pooh excitedly.<br>\\\"I\\'ve had it,\\\" said Eeyore.<br>P<br>ooh had now splashed across the stream to<br>Eeyore, and Piglet was sitting a little way off, his head<br>in his paws, snuffling to himself.<br>\\\"It\\'s a Useful Pot,\\\" said Pooh. \\\"Here it is. And it\\'s<br>got \\'A Very Happy Birthday with love from Pooh\\'<br>written on it. That\\'s what all that writing is. And it\\'s<br>for putting things in. There!\\\"<br>When Eeyore saw the pot, he became quite excited.<br>\\\"Why!\\\" he said. \\\"I believe my Balloon will just go<br>into that Pot!\\\"<br>\\\"Oh no, Eeyore,\\\" said Pooh. \\\"Balloons are much<br>too big to go into Pots. What you do with a balloon<br>is, you hold the balloon--\\\"<br>\\\"Not mine,\\\" said Eeyore proudly. \\\"Look, Piglet!\\\"<br>And as Piglet looked sorrowfully round, Eeyore<br>picked the balloon up with his teeth, and placed it<br>carefully in the pot; picked it out and put it on the<br>ground; and then picked it up again and put it care-<br>fully back.<br>\\\"So it does!\\\" said Pooh. \\\"It goes in!\\\"<br>\\\"So it does!\\\" said Piglet. \\\"And it comes out!\\\"<br>\\\"Doesn\\'t it?\\\" said Eeyore. \\\"It goes in and out like<br>anything.\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'m very glad,\\\" said Pooh happily, \\\"that I thought<br>of giving you a Useful Pot to put things in.\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'m very glad,\\\" said Piglet happily, \\\"that I<br>thought of giving you Something to put in a Useful<br>Pot.\\\"<br>But Eeyore wasn\\'t listening. He was taking the balloon out, and putting it back again, as happy as could<br>be....<br>\\\"And didn\\'t I give him anything?\\\" asked Christopher Robin sadly.<br>\\\"Of course you did,\\\" I said. \\\"You gave him-don\\'t you remember- a little- a little --\\\"<br>\\\"I gave him a box of paints to paint things with.\\\"<br>\\\"That was it.\\\"<br>\\\"Why didn\\'t I give it to him in the morning?\\\"<br>\\\"You were so busy getting his party ready for him. He had a cake with icing on the top, and three candles, and his name in pink sugar, and--\\\"<br>\\\"Yes, I remember,\\\" said Christopher Robin.<br>CHAPTER VII<br>In Which<br>Kanga and Baby Roo Come to the Forest, and Piglet Has a Bath<br>N<br>OBODY seemed to know here they came from, but there they were in the Forest: Kanga and Baby Roo. When Pooh asked Christopher Robin, \\\"How did they come here?\\\" Christopher Robin said, \\\"In the Usual Way, if you know what I mean, Pooh,\\\" and Pooh, who didn\\'t, said \\\"Oh!\\\" Then he nodded his head twice and said, \\\"In the Usual Way. Ah!\\\" Then he went to call upon his friend Piglet to see what he thought about it. And at Piglet\\'s house he found Rabbit. So they all talked about it together.<br>\\\"What I don\\'t like about it is this,\\\" said Rabbit. \\\"Here are we- you, Pooh, and you, Piglet, and Me- and suddenly--\\\"<br>\\\"And Eeyore,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"And Eeyore- and then suddenly--\\\"<br>\\\"And Owl,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"And Owl- and then all of a sudden --\\\"<br>\\\"Oh, and Eeyore,\\\" said Pooh. \\\"I was forgetting him.\\\"<br>\\\"Here-we-are,\\\" said Rabbit very slowly and carefully, \\\"all-of-us, and then, suddenly, we wake up one morning and, what do we find? We find a Strange Animal among us. An animal of whom we have never even heard before! An animal who carries her family about with her in her pocket! Suppose I carried my family about with me in my pocket, how many pockets should I want?\\\"<br>\\\"Sixteen,\\\" said Piglet.<br>\\\"Seventeen, isn\\'t it?\\\" said Rabbit. \\\"And one more for a handkerchief-that\\'s eighteen. Eighteen pockets in one suit! I haven\\'t time.\\\"<br>There was a long and thoughtful silence ... and then Pooh, who had been frowning very hard for some minutes, said: \\\"I make it fifteen.\\\"<br>\\\"<br>What?\\\" said Rabbit.<br>\\\"Fiteen.\\\"<br>\\\"<br>Ffeen what?\\\"<br>\\\"Your family.\\\"<br>\\\"<br>What about them?\\\"<br>Pooh rubbed his nose and said that he thought Rabbit had been talking about his family.<br>\\\"Did I?\\\" said Rabbit carelessly.<br>\\\"Yes, you said--\\\"<br>\\\"Never mind, Pooh,\\\" said Piglet impatiently.<br>\\\"The question is, What are we to do about Kanga?\\\"<br>\\\"Oh, I see,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"The best way,\\\" said Rabbit, \\\"would be this. The best way would be to steal Baby Roo and hide him, and then when Kanga says, \\'Where\\'s Baby Roo?\\' we say, Aha!\\'\\\"<br>\\\"Aha!\\\" said Pooh, practising. \\\"Aha! Aha!... Of course,\\\" he went on, \\\"we could say \\'Aha!\\' even if we hadn\\'t stolen Baby Roo.\\\"<br>\\\"Pooh,\\\" said Rabbit kindly, \\\"you haven\\'t any brain.\\\"<br>\\\"I know,\\\" said Pooh humbly.<br>\\\"We say \\'Aha!\\' so that Kanga knows that we know where Baby Roo is. \\'Aha!\\' means \\'We\\'ll tell you where Baby Roo is, if you promise to go away from the Forest and never come back.\\' Now don\\'t talk while I think.\\\"<br>Pooh went into a corner and tried saying \\\"Aha!\\\" in that sort of voice. Sometimes it seemed to him that it did mean what Rabbit said, and sometimes it seemed to him that it didn\\'t.<br>\\\"I suppose it\\'s just practice,\\\" he thought. \\\"I wonder if Kanga will have to practise too so as to understand it.\\\"<br>\\\"There\\'s just one thing\\\" said Piglet, fidgeting a bit. \\\"I was talking to Christopher Robin, and he said that a Kanga was Generally Regarded as One of the Fiercer Animals. I am not frightened of Fierce Animals in the ordinary way, but it is well known that, if One of the Fiercer Animals is Deprived of Its Young, it becomes as fierce as Two of the Fiercer Animals. In which case \\'Aha!\\' is perhaps a foolish thing to say.\\\"<br>\\\"Piglet\\\" said Rabbit, taking out a pencil, and licking the end of it, \\\"you haven\\'t any pluck.\\\"<br>\\\"It is hard to be brave,\\\" said Piglet, sniffing slightly, \\\"when you\\'re only a Very Small Animal.\\\"<br>Rabbit, who had begun to write very busily, looked up and said:<br>\\\"It is because you are a very small animal that you will be Useful in the adventure before us.\\\"<br>Piglet was so excited at the idea of being Useful that he forgot to be frightened any more, and when Rabbit went on to say that Kangas were only Fierce during the winter months, being at other times of an Affectionate Disposition, he could hardly sit still, he was so eager to begin being useful at once.<br>\\\"What about me?\\\" said Pooh sadly. \\\"I suppose I shan\\'t be useful?\\\"<br>\\\"Never mind, Pooh\\\" said Piglet comfortingly. \\\"Another time perhaps.\\\"<br>\\\"Without Pooh,\\\" said Rabbit solemnly as he sharpened his pencil, \\\"the adventure would be impossible.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" said Piglet, and tried not to look disappointed.<br>But Pooh went into a corner of the room and said proudly to himself, \\\"Impossible without Me! That sort of Bear.\\\"<br>\\\"Now listen all of you\\\" said Rabbit when he had finished writing, and Pooh and Piglet sat listening very eagerly with their mouths open. This was what Rabbit read out:<br>PLAN TO CAPTURE BABY ROO<br>1. General Remarks. Kanga runs faster than any of Us, even Me.<br>2. More General Remarks. Kanga never takes her eye off Baby Roo, except when he\\'s safely buttoned up in her pocket.<br>3. Therefore. If we are to capture Baby Roo, we must get a Long Start, because Kanga runs faster than any of Us, even Me. (See 1.)<br>4. A Thought. If Roo had jumped out of Kanga\\'s pocket and Piglet had jumped in, Kanga wouldn\\'t know the difference, because Piglet is a Very Small Animal.<br>5. Like Roo.<br>6. But Kanga would have to be looking the other way first, so as not to see Piglet jumping in.<br>7. See 2.<br>8. Another Thought. But if Pooh was talking to oher very excitedly, she might look the other way for a moment.<br>9. And then I could run away with Roo.<br>10. Quickly.<br>11. And Kanga wouldn\\'t discover the difference until After-wards.<br>Well, Rabbit read this out proudly, and for a little while after he had read it nobody said anything. And then Piglet, who had been opening and shutting his mouth without making any noise, managed to say very huskily:<br>\\\"And-Afterwards?\\\"<br>\\\"How do you mean?\\\"<br>\\\"When Kanga does Discover the Difference?\\\"<br>\\\"Then we all say \\'Aha!\\'\\\"<br>\\\"All three of us?\\\"<br>\\\"Yes.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh!\\\"<br>\\\"Why, what\\'s the trouble, Piglet?\\\"<br>\\\"Nothing,\\\" said Piglet, \\\"As long as we all three say it. As long as we all three say it,\\\" said Piglet, \\\"I don\\'t mind,\\\" he said, \\\"but I shouldn\\'t care to say \\'Aha!\\' by myself. It wouldn\\'t sound nearly so well. By the way,\\\" he said, \\\"you are quite sure about what you said about the winter months?\\\"<br>\\\"The winter months?\\\"<br>\\\"Yes, only being Fierce in the Winter Months.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh, yes, yes, that\\'s all right. Well, Pooh? You see what you have to do?\\\"<br>\\\"No,\\\" said Pooh Bear. \\\"Not yet,\\\" he said. \\\"What do I do?\\\"<br>\\\"Well, you just have to talk very hard to Kanga so as she doesn\\'t notice anything.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh! What about?\\\"<br>\\\"Anything you like.\\\"<br>\\\"You mean like telling her a little bit of poetry or something?\\\"<br>\\\"That\\'s it,\\\" said Rabbit. \\\"Splendid. Now come along.\\\"<br>So they all went out to look for Kanga.<br>Kanga and Roo were spending a queit afternoon in a sandy part of the Forest. Baby Roo was practising very small jumps in the sand, and falling down mouse-holes and climbing out of them, and Kanga was fidgeting about and saying \\\"Just one more jump, dear, and then we must go home. \\\" And at that moment who should come stumping up the hill but Pooh.<br>\\\"Good afternoon, Kanga.\\\"<br>\\\"Good afternoon, Pooh.\\\"<br>\\\"Look at me jumping,\\\" squeaked Roo, and fell into another mouse-hole.<br>\\\"Hallo, Roo, my little fellow!\\\"<br>\\\"We were just going home,\\\" said Kanga. \\\"Good afternoon, Rabbit. Good afternoon, Piglet.\\\"<br>Rabbit and Piglet, who had now come up from the other side of the hill, said, \\\"Good afternoon,\\\" and \\\"Hallo, Roo,\\\" and Roo asked them to look at him jumping, so they stayed and looked.<br>And Kanga looked too....<br>\\\"Oh, Kanga,\\\" said Pooh, after Rabbit had winked at him twice, \\\"I don\\'t know if you are interested in Poetry at all?\\\"<br>\\\"Hardly at all,\\\" said Kanga.<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"Roo, dear, just one more jump and then we must go home.\\\"<br>There was a short silence while Roo fell down another mouse-hole.<br>\\\"Go on,\\\" said Rabbit in a loud whisper behind his paw.<br>\\\"Talking of Poetry,\\\" said Pooh, \\\"I made up a little piece as I was coming along. It went like this. Er-- now let me see--\\\"<br>\\\"Fancy!\\\" said Kanga. \\\"Now Roo, dear--\\\"<br>\\\"You\\'ll like this piece of poetry,\\\" said Rabbit.<br>\\\"You\\'ll love it,\\\" said Piglet.<br>\\\"You must listen very carefully,\\\" said Rabbit.<br>\\\"So as not to miss any of it,\\\" said Piglet.<br>\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" said Kanga, but she still looked at Baby Roo.<br>\\\"How did it go, Pooh?\\\" said Rabbit.<br>Pooh gave a little cough and began.<br>LINES WRITTEN BY A BEAR OF VERY LITTLE BRAIN<br>On Monday, when the sun is hot<br>I wonder to myself a lot:<br>\\\"Now is it true, or is it not,<br>\\\"That what is which and which is what?\\\"<br>On Tuesday, when it hails and snows,<br>The feeling on me grows and grows<br>That hardly anybody knows<br>If those are these or these are those.<br>On Wednesday, when the sky is blue,<br>And I have nothing else to do,<br>I sometimes wonder if it\\'s true<br>That who is what and what is who.<br>On Thursday, when it starts to freeze<br>And hoar-frost twinkles on the trees,<br>How very readily one sees<br>That these are whose -but whose are these?<br>On Friday--<br>\\\"Yes, it is, isn\\'t it?\\\" said Kanga, not waiting to hear what happened on Friday. \\\"Just one more jump, Roo, dear, and then we really must be going.\\\"<br>Rabbit gave Pooh a hurrying-up sort of nudge.<br>\\\"Talking of Poetry,\\\" said Pooh quickly, \\\"have you ever noticed that tree right over there?\\\"<br>\\\"Where?\\\" said Kanga. \\\"Now, Roo--\\\"<br>\\\"Right over there,\\\" said Pooh, pointing behind K<br>anga\\'s back.<br>\\\"No,\\\" said Kanga. \\\"Now jump in, Roo, dear, and we\\'ll go home.\\\"<br>\\\"You ought to look at that tree right over there,\\\" said Rabbit. \\\"Shall I lift you in, Roo?\\\" And he picked up Roo in his paws.<br>\\\"I can see a bird in it from here,\\\" said Pooh. \\\"Or is it a fish?\\\"<br>\\\"You ought to see that bird from here,\\\" said Rabbit. \\\"Unless it\\'s a fish.\\\"<br>\\\"It isn\\'t a fish, it\\'s a bird,\\\" said Piglet.<br>\\\"So it is,\\\" said Rabbit.<br>\\\"Is it a starling or a blackbird?\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"That\\'s a whole question,\\\" said Rabbit. \\\"Is it a blackbird or a starling?\\\"<br>And then at last Kanga did turn her head to look. And the moment that her head was turned, Rabbit said in a loud voice \\\"In you go, Roo!\\\" and in jumped Piglet into Kanga\\'s pocket, and off scampered Rabbit, with Roo in his paws, as fast as he could.<br>\\\"Why, where\\'s Rabbit?\\\" said Kanga, turning round again. \\\"Are you all right, Roo, dear?\\\"<br>Piglet made a squeaky Roo-noise from the bottom of Kanga\\'s pocket.<br>\\\"Rabbit had to go away,\\\" said Pooh. \\\"I think he thought of something he had to go and see about suddenly.\\\"<br>\\\"And Piglet?\\\"<br>\\\"I think Piglet thought of something at the same time. Suddenly.\\\"<br>\\\"Well, we must be getting home,\\\" said Kanga. \\\"Good-bye, Pooh.\\\" And in three large jumps she was gone.<br>Pooh looked after her as she went.<br>\\\"I wish I could jump like that,\\\" he thought. \\\"Some can and some can\\'t. That\\'s how it is.\\\"<br>But there were moments when Piglet wished that Kanga couldn\\'t. Often, when he had had a long walk home through the Forest, he had wished that he were a bird; but now he thought jerkily to himself at the bottom of Kanga\\'s pocket,<br>\\\"If this is flying I shall never really take to it.\\\"<br>And as he went up in the air, he said, \\\"Ooooooo!\\\"<br>and as he came down he said, \\\"Ow!\\\" And he was saying, \\\"Ooooooo-ow, Ooooooo-ow, Ooooooo-ow\\\" all the way to Kanga\\'s house.<br>Of course as soon as Kanga unbuttoned her pocket, she saw what had happened. Just for a moment, she thought she was frightened, and then she knew she wasn\\'t; for she felt quite sure that Christopher Robin would never let any harm happen to Roo. So she said to herself, \\\"If they are having a joke with me, I will have a joke with them.\\\"<br>\\\"Now then, Roo, dear,\\\" she said, as she took Piglet out of her pocket. \\\"Bed-time.\\\"<br>\\\"Aha!\\\" said Piglet, as well as he could after his Terrifying Journey. But it wasn\\'t a very good \\\"Aha!\\\" and Kanga didn\\'t seem to understand what it meant.<br>\\\"Aha! said Piglet again, looking round anxiously for the others. But the others weren\\'t there. Rabbit was playing with Baby Roo in his own house, and feeling more fond of him every minute, and Pooh, who had decided to be a Kanga, was still at the sandy place on the top of the Forest, practising jumps.<br>\\\"I am not at all sure,\\\" said Kanga in a thoughtful voice, \\\"that it wouldn\\'t be a good idea to have a cold bath this evening. Would you like that, Roo, dear?\\\"<br>Piglet, who had never really been fond of baths,<br>shuddered a long indignant shudder, and said in as brave a voice as he could:<br>\\\"Kanga, I see the time has come to speak plainly.\\\"<br>\\\"Funny little Roo,\\\" said Kanga, as she got the bathwater ready.<br>\\\"I am not Roo,\\\" said Piglet loudly. \\\"I am Piglet!\\\"<br>\\\"Yes, dear, yes,\\\" said Kanga soothingly. \\\"And imitating Piglet\\'s voice too! So clever of him,\\\" she went on as she took a large bar of yellow soap out of the cupboard. \\\"What will he be doing next?\\\"<br>\\\"Can\\'t you see?\\\" shouted Piglet. \\\"Haven\\'t you got eyes? Look at me!\\\"<br>\\\"I am looking, Roo, dear\\\" said Kanga rather severely. \\\"And you know what I told you yesterday about making faces. If you go on making faces like Piglet\\'s, you will grow up to look like Piglet- and then think how sorry you will be. Now then, into the bath, and don\\'t let me have to speak to you about it again.\\\"<br>Before he knew where he was, Piglet was in the bath, and Kanga was scrubbing him firmly with a large lathery flannel.<br>\\\"Ow!\\\" cried Piglet.\\\"Let me out! I\\'m Piglet!\\\"<br>\\\"Don\\'t open the mouth, dear, or the soap goes in,\\\" said Kanga. \\\"There! What did I tell you?\\\"<br>\\\"You-you-you did it on purpose,\\\" spluttered Piglet, as soon as he could speak again ... and then accidentally had another mouthful of lathery flannel.<br>\\\"That\\'s right, dear, don\\'t say anything,\\\"\\\" said Kanga, and in another minute Piglet was out of the bath, and being rubbed dry with a towel.<br>\\\"Now,\\\" said Kanga, \\\"there\\'s your medicine, and then bed.\\\"<br>\\\"W-w-what medicine?\\\" said Piglet.<br>\\\"To make you grow big and strong, dear. You don\\'t want to grow up small and weak like Piglet, do you? Well, then!\\\"<br>At that moment there was a knock on the door.<br>\\\"Come in,\\\" said Kanga, and in came Christopher Robin.<br>\\\"Christopher Robin, Christopher Robin!\\\" cried Piglet. \\\"Tell Kanga who I am! She keeps saying I\\'m Roo. I\\'m not Roo, am I?\\\"<br>Christopher Robin looked at him very carefully, and shook his head. \\\"You can\\'t be Roo,\\\" he said, \\\"because I\\'ve just seen Roo playing in Rabbit\\'s house.\\\"<br>\\\"Well!\\\" said Kanga. \\\"Fancy that! Fancy my making a mistake like that.\\\"<br>\\\"There you are!\\\" said Piglet. \\\"I told you so. I\\'m Piglet.\\\"<br>Christopher Robin shook his head again.<br>\\\"Oh, you\\'re not Piglet,\\\" he said. \\\"I know Piglet well, and he\\'s quite a different color.\\\"<br>Piglet began to say that this was because he had just had a bath, and then he thought that perhaps he wouldn\\'t say that, and as he opened his mouth to say something else, Kanga slipped the medicine spoon in, and then patted him on the back and told him that it was really quite a nice taste when you got used to it.<br>\\\"I knew it wasn\\'t Piglet,\\\" said Kanga.\\\"I wonder who it can be.\\\"<br>\\\"Perhaps it\\'s some relation of Pooh\\'s\\\" said Christopher Robin. \\\"What about a nephew or an uncle or something?\\\"<br>Kanga agreed that this was probably what it was, and said that they would have to call it by some name.<br>\\\"I shall call it Pootel,\\\" said Christopher Robin. \\\"Henry Pootel for short.\\\"<br>And just when it was decided, Henry Pootel wriggled out of Kanga\\'s arms and jumped to the ground. To his great joy Christopher Robin had left the door open. Never had Henry Pootel Piglet run so fast sa he ran then, and he didn\\'t stop running until he had got quite close to his house. But when he was a hundred yards away he stopped running, and rolled the rest of the way home, so as to het his own nice comfortable colour again....<br>So Kanga and Roo stayed in the Forest. And every Tuesday Roo spent the day with her great friend Pooh, teaching him to jump, and every Tuesday Piglet spent the day with his great friend Christopher Robin. So they were all happy again.<br>CHAPTER VIII<br>In Which<br>Christopher Robin Leads an Expotition to the North Pole<br>One fine day Pooh had stumped up to the top of the Forest to see if his friend Christopher Robin was interested in Bears at all. At breakfast that morning (a simple meal of marmalade spread lightly over a honeycomb or two) he had suddenly thought of a new song. It began like this:<br>\\\"Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear!\\\"<br>When he had got as far as this, he stretched his head, and thought to himself \\\"That\\'s a very good start for a song, but what about the second line?\\\" He tried singing \\\"Ho,\\\" two or three times, but it didn\\'t seem to help. \\\"Perhaps it would be better,\\\" he thought, \\\"if I sang Hi for the life of a Bear.\\\" So he sang it ... but it wasn\\'t. \\\"Very well, then,\\\" he said, \\\"I shall sing that first line twice, and perhaps if I sing<br>it very quickly, I shall find myself singing the third and fourth lines before I have time to think of them, and that will be a Good Song. Now then:<br>\\\"<br>Sing Ho! For the life of a Bear!<br>Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear!<br>I don\\'t much mind if it rains or snows,<br>\\'Cos I\\'ve got a lot of honey on my nice<br>new nose,<br>I don\\'t much care if it snows or thaws, \\'Cos I\\'ve got a lot of honey on my nice clean paws!<br>Sing Ho! for a Bear!<br>Sing Ho! for a Pooh!<br>And I\\'ll have a little something in an hour or two!<br>He was so pleased with this song chat he sang it all the way to the top of the Forest, \\\"and if I go on singing it much longer,\\\" he thought, \\\"it will be time for the little something, and then the last line won\\'t be true.\\\" So he turned it into a hum instead.<br>Christopher Robin was sitting outside his door, putting on his Big Boots. As soon as he saw the Big<br>Boots, Pooh knew that an Adventure was going to happen, and he brushed the honey off his nose with the back of his paw, and spruced himself up as well as he could, so as to look Ready for Anything.<br>\\\"Good-morning, Christopher Robin,\\\" he called out.<br>Hallo, Pooh Bear. I can\\'t get this boot on.\\\"<br>\\\"That\\'s bad,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"Do you think you could very kindly lean against me, \\'cos I keep pulling so hard that I fall over backwards.\\\"<br>Pooh sat down, dug his feet into the ground, and pushed hard against Christopher Robin\\'s back, and Christopher Robin pushed hard against his, and pulled and pulled at his boot until he had got it on.<br>\\\"And that\\'s that,\\\" said Pooh. \\\"What do we do next?\\\"<br>\\\"We are all going on an Expedition,\\\" said Christopher Robin, as he got up and brushed himself. \\\"Thank you, Pooh.\\\"<br>\\\"Going on an Expotition?\\\" said Pooh eagerly. \\\"I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever been on one of those. Where are we going to on this Expotition?\\\"<br>\\\"Expedition, silly old Bear. It\\'s got an \\'x\\' in it.\\\" \\\"Oh!\\\" said Pooh. \\\"* know.\\\" But he didn\\'t really. \\\"We\\'re going to discover the North Pole.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" said Pooh again. \\\"What is the North Pole?\\\"<br>he asked.<br>\\\"It\\'s just a thing you discover,\\\" said Christopher Robin carelessly, not being quite sure himself.<br>\\\"Oh! I see,\\\" said Pooh. \\\"Are bears any good at<br>discovering it?\\\"<br>\\\"Of course they are. And Rabbit and Kanga and all of you. It\\'s an Expedition. That\\'s what an Expedition means. A long line of everybody. You\\'d better tell the others to get ready, while I see if my gun\\'s all right. And we must all bring Provisions.\\\"<br>\\\"Bring what?\\\" \\\"Things to eat.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" said Pooh happily. \\\"I thought you said Provisions. I\\'ll go and tell them.\\\" And he stumped off.<br>The first person he met was Rabbit.<br>\\\"Hallo, Rabbit,\\\" he said, \\\"is that you?\\\"<br>\\\"Let\\'s pretend it isn\\'t,\\\" said Rabbit, \\\"and see what happens.\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'ve got a message for you.\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'ll give it to him.\\\"<br>\\\"We\\'re all going on an Expotition with Christopher Robin!\\\"<br>\\\"What is it when we\\'r eon it?\\\"<br>\\\"A sort of boat, I think,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"Oh! that sort.\\\"<br>\\\"Yes. And we\\'re going to discover a Pole or something. Or was it a Mole? Anyhow we\\'re going to discoer it.\\\"<br>\\\"We are, are we?\\\" said Rabbit.<br>\\\"Yes. And we\\'ve got to bring Po- things to eat with us. In case we want to eat them. Now I\\'m going down to Piglet\\'s. Tell Kanga, will you?\\\"<br>He left Rabbit and hurried down to Piglet\\'s house. The Piglet was sitting on the ground at the door of his house blowing happily at a dandelion, and wondering whether it would be this year, next year, sometime or never. He had just discovered that it would be never, and was trying to remember what \\\"it\\\" was, and hoping it wasn\\'t anything nice, when Pooh came up.<br>\\\"Oh! Piglet,\\\" said Pooh excitedly, \\\"we\\'re going on an Expotition, all of us, with things to eat. To discover something.\\\"<br>\\\"To discover what?\\\" said Piglet anxiously.<br>\\\"Oh! just something.\\\"<br>\\\"Nothing fierce?\\\"<br>\\\"Christopher Robin didn\\'t say anything about fierce. He just said it had an \\'x\\'.\\\"<br>\\\"It isn\\'t their necks I mind,\\\" said Piglet earnestly. \\\"It\\'s their teeth. But if Christopher Robin is coming I don\\'t mind anything.\\\"<br>In a little while they were all ready at the top of the Forest, and the Expotition started. First came Christopher Robin and RAbbit, then Piglet and Pooh; then Kanga, with Roo in her pocket, and Owl; then Eeyore; and, at the end, in a long line, all Rabbit\\'s friends-and-relations.<br>\\\"I didn\\'t ask them,\\\" explained Rabbit carelessly. \\\"They just came. They always do. They can march at the end, after Eeyore.\\\"<br>\\\"What I say,\\\" said Eeyore, \\\"is that it\\'s unsettling. I didn\\'t want to come on this Epo- what Pooh said. I only came to oblige. But here I am; and if I am the end of the Expo- what we\\'re talking about- then let me be the end. But if, every time I want to sit down for a little rest, I have to brush away half a dozen of Rabbit\\'s smaller friends and relations first, then this isn\\'t an Expo- whatever it is- at all, it\\'s simply a Confused Noise. That\\'s what I say.\\\"<br>\\\"I see what Eeyore means,\\\" said Owl. \\\"If you ask me--\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'m not asking anybody,\\\" said Eeyore. \\\"I\\'m just telling everybody. We can look for the North Pole, or we can play \\'Here we go gathering Nuts and May\\' with the end part of an ant\\'s nest. It\\'s all the same to me.\\\"<br>There was a shout from the top of the line.<br>\\\"Come on!\\\" called Christopher Robin.<br>\\\"Come on! called Pooh and Piglet.\\\"<br>\\\"Come on!\\\" called Owl.<br>\\\"We\\'re starting,\\\" said Rabbit. \\\"I must go.\\\" And he hurried off to the front of the expotition with Christopher Robin.<br>\\\"All right,\\\" said Eeyore. \\\"We\\'re going. Only Don\\'t Blame Me.\\\"<br>So off they all went to discover the Pole. And as they walked, they chattered to each other of this and that, all except Pooh, who was making up a song.<br>\\\"This is the first verse,\\\" he said to Piglet, when he was ready with it.<br>\\\"First verse of what?\\\"<br>\\\"My song.\\\"<br>\\\"What song?\\\"<br>\\\"This one.\\\"<br>\\\"Which one?\\\"<br>\\\"Well, if you listen, Piglet, you\\'ll hear it.\\\"<br>\\\"How do you know I\\'m not listening?<br>Pooh couldn\\'t answer that one, so he began to sing.<br>They all went off to discover the Pole,<br>Owl and Piglet and Rabbit and all;<br>It\\'s a Thing you Discover, as I\\'ve been tole<br>By Owl and Piglet and Rabbit and all.<br>Eeyore, Christopher Robin and Pooh<br>And Rabbit\\'s relations all went too--<br>And where the Pole was none of them knew....<br>Sing Hey! for Owl and Rabbit and all!<br>\\\"Hush!\\\" said Christopher Robin turning round to Pooh, \\\"we\\'re just coming to a Dangerous Place.\\\"<br>\\\"Hush!\\\" said Pooh turning round quickly to Piglet.<br>\\\"Hush!\\\" said Piglet to Kanga.<br>\\\"Hush!\\\" said Kanga to Owl, while Roo said \\\"Hush!\\\" several times to himself very quietly.<br>\\\"Hush!\\\" said Owl to Eeyore.<br>\\\"Hush!\\\" said Eeyore in a terrible voice to all Rabbit\\'s friends -and -relations, and \\\"Hush!\\\" they said hastily to each other all down the line, until it got to the last one of all. And the last and smallest friend -and-relarion was so upset to find that the whole Expotitian was saying \\\"Hush!\\\" to him, that he buried himself head downwards in a crack in the ground,<br>and stayed there for two days until the danger was over, and then went home in a great hurry, and lived quietly with his Aunt ever- afterwards. His name was Alexander Beetle.<br>They had come to a stream which twisted and tumbled between high rocky banks, and Christopher robin saw at once how dangerous it was.<br>\\\"It\\'s just the place,\\\" he explained, \\\"for an Ambush.\\\"<br>\\\"What sort of bush?\\\" whispered Pooh to Piglet. \\\"A gorse bush?\\\"<br>\\\"My dear Pooh,\\\" said Owl in his superior way, \\\"don\\'t you know what an Ambush is?\\\"<br>\\\"Owl,\\\" said Piglet, looking round at him severely, \\\"Pooh\\'s whisper was a perfectly private whisper, and there was no need--\\\"<br>\\\"An ambush,\\\" said Owl, \\\"is a sort of Surprise.\\\"<br>\\\"So is a gorse-bush sometimes\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"An Ambush, as I was about to explain to Pooh,\\\" said Piglet, \\\"is a sort of Surprise.\\\"<br>\\\"If people jump out at you suddenly, that\\'s an Ambush,\\\" said Owl.<br>\\\"It\\'s an Ambush, Pooh, when people jump at you suddenly,\\\" explained Piglet.<br>Pooh, who now knew what an Ambush was, said that a gorse-bush had sprung at him suddenly one day when he fell off a tree, and he had taken six days to get all the prickles out of himself.<br>\\\"We are not talking about gorse-bushes.\\\" said Owl a little crossly.<br>\\\"I am,\\\" said Pooh.<br>They were climbing very cautiously up the stream now, going from rock to rock, and after they had gone a little way they came to a place where the banks widened out at each side, so that on each side of the water there was a level strip of grass on which they could sit down and rest. As soon as he saw this, Christopher Robin called \\\"Halt!\\\" and they all sat down and rested.<br>\\\"I think,\\\" said Christopher Tobin, \\\"that we ought to eat all our Provisions now, so that we shan\\'t have so much to carry.\\\"<br>\\\"Eat all out what?\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"All that we\\'ve brought,\\\" said Piglet, getting to work.<br>\\\"That\\'s a good idea,\\\" said Pooh, and he got to work too.<br>\\\"Have you all got something?\\\" asked Christopher Robin with his mouth full.<br>\\\"All except me,\\\" said Eeyore. \\\"As Usual.\\\" He looked around at him in his melancholy way. \\\"I suppose none of you are sitting on a thistle by any chance?\\\"<br>\\\"I believe I am,\\\" said Pooh. \\\"Ow!\\\" He got up, and looked behind him. \\\"Yes, I was. I thought so.\\\"<br>\\\"Thank you, Pooh. If you\\'ve quite finished with it.\\\" He moved across to Pooh\\'s place, and began to eat.<br>\\\"It don\\'t do them any Good, you know, sitting on them,\\\" he went on, as he looked up munching. \\\"Takes all the Life out of them. Remember that another time, all of you. A little Consideration, a little Thought for Others, makes all the difference.\\\"<br>As soon as he had finished his lunch Christopher Robin whispered to Rabbit, and Rabbit said, \\\"Yes, yes, of course,\\\" and they walked a little way up the stream together.<br>\\\"I didn\\'t want the others to hear\\\" said Christopher Robin.<br>\\\"Quite so,\\\" said Rabbit, looking important.<br>\\\"It\\'s-I wondered-It\\'s only-Rabbit, I suppose you don\\'t know, What does the North Pole look like.\\\"<br>\\\"Well,\\\" said Rabbit, stroking his whiskers. \\\"Now you\\'re asking me.\\\"<br>\\\"I did know once, only I\\'ve sort of forgotten,\\\" said Christopher Robin carelessly.<br>\\\"It\\'s a funny thing,\\\" said Rabbit, \\\"but I\\'ve sort of forgotten too, although I did know once.\\\"<br>\\\"I suppose it\\'s just a pole stuck in the ground?\\\"<br>\\\"Sure to be a pole,\\\" said Rabbit, \\\"because of calling a pole, and if it\\'s a pole, well, I should think it would be sticking to the ground, shouldn\\'t you, because there\\'d be nowhere else to stick it.\\\"<br>\\\"Yes, that\\'s what I thought.\\\"<br>\\\"The only thing,\\\" said Rabbit, \\\"is, where is it sticking?\\\"<br>\\\"That\\'s what we\\'re looking for,\\\" said Christopher Robin.<br>They went back to the others. Piglet was lying on his back, sleeping peacefully. Roo was washing his face and paws in the stream, while Kanga explained to everybody proudly that this was the first time he had ever washed his face himself, and Owl was telling Kanga an Interesting Anecdote full of long words like Encyclopedia and Rhododendron to which Kanga wasn\\'t listening.<br>\\\"I don\\'t hold with all this washing,\\\" grumbled Eeyore. \\\"This modern Behind-the-ears nonsense. What do you think, Pooh?\\\"<br>\\\"Well,\\\" said Pooh, \\\"I think--\\\"<br>But we shall never know what Pooh thought, for there came a sudden squeak from Roo, a splash, and a loud cry of alarm from Kanga.<br>\\\"So much for washing,\\\" said Eeyore.<br>\\\"Roo\\'s fallen in!\\\" cried Rabbit, and he and Christopher Robin came rushing down to the rescue.<br>\\\"Look at me swimming!\\\" squeaked Roo from the middle of his pool, and was hurried down a waterfall into the next pool.<br>\\\"Are you all right, Roo dear?\\\" called Kanga anxiously.<br>\\\"Yes!\\\" said Roo. \\\"Look at me sw--\\\" and down he went over the next waterfall into another pool.<br>Everybody was doing something to help. Piglet, wide awake suddenly, was jumping up and down and making \\\"Oo, I say\\\" noises; Owl was explaining that in a case of Sudden and Temporary Immersion the Important Thing was to keep the Head Above Water;<br>Kanga was jumping along the bank, saying \\\"Are you sure you\\'re all right, Roo dear?\\\" to which Roo, from whatever pool he was in at the moment, was answering<br>\\\"Look at me swimming!\\\" Eeyore had turned round and hung his tail over the first pool into which Roo fell, and with his back to the accident was grumbling quietly to himself, and saying, \\\"All this washing; but catch on to my tail, little Roo, and you\\'ll be all right\\\"; and, Christopher Robin and Rabbit came hurrying past Eeyore, and were calling out to the others in front of them.<br>\\\"All right, Roo, I\\'m coming,\\\" called Christopher Robin.<br>\\\"Get something across the stream lower down, some of you fellows,\\\" called Rabbit.<br>But Pooh was getting something. Two pools below Roo he was standing with a long pole in his paws, and Kanga came up and took one end of it, and between them they held it across the lower part of the pool; and Roo still bubbling proudly, \\\"Look at me swimming,\\\" drifted up against it, and climbed out.<br>\\\"Did you see me swimming?\\\" squeaked Roo excitedly, while Kanga scolded him and rubbed him down.<br>\\\"Pooh, did you see me swimming? That\\'s called swimming, what I was doing. Rabbit, did you see what I was doing? Swimming. Hallo, Piglet! I say, Piglet! What do you think I was doing! Swimming! Christopher Robin, did you see me--\\\"<br>But Christopher Robin wasn\\'t listening. He was looking at Pooh.<br>\\\"Pooh,\\\" he said, \\\"where did you find that pole?\\\"<br>Pooh looked at the pole in both his hands.<br>\\\"I just found it,\\\" he said. \\\"I thought it ought to be useful. I just picked it up.\\\"<br>\\\"Pooh,\\\" said Christopher Robin solemnly, \\\"the Expedition is over. You have found the North Pole!\\\"<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" said Pooh.<br>Eeyore was sitting with his tail in the water when they all got back to him.<br>\\\"Tell Roo to be quick, somebody,\\\" he said. \\\"My tail\\'s getting cold. I don\\'t want to mention it, but I just mention it. I don\\'t want to complain but there it is. My tail\\'s cold.\\\"<br>\\\"Here I am!\\\" squeaked Roo.<br>\\\"Oh, there you are.\\\"<br>\\\"Did you see me swimming?\\\"<br>Eeyore took his tail out of the water, and swished it from side to side.<br>\\\"As i expected,\\\" he said. \\\"Lost all feeling. Numbed it. That\\'s what it\\'s done. Numbed it. Well, as long as nobody minds, I suppose it\\'s all right.\\\"<br>\\\"Poor old Eeyore. I\\'ll dry it for you,\\\" said Christopher Robin, and he took out his handkerchief and rubbed it up.<br>\\\"Thank you, Christopher Robin. You\\'re the only one who seems to understand about tails. They don\\'t think-that\\'s what\\'s the matter with some of these others. They\\'ve no imagination. A tail isn\\'t a tail to them, it\\'s just a Little Bit Extra at the back.\\\"<br>\\\"Never mind, Eeyore,\\\" said Christopher Robin, rubbing his hardest. \\\"Is that better?\\\"<br>\\\"It\\'s feeling more like a tail perhaps. It Belongs again, if you know what I mean.\\\"<br>\\\"Hullo, Eeyore,\\\" said Pooh, coming up to them with his pole.<br>\\\"Hullo, Pooh. Thank you for asking, but I shall be able to use it again in a day or two.\\\"<br>\\\"Use what?\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"What we are talking about.\\\"<br>\\\"I wasn\\'t talking about anything,\\\" said Pooh, looking puzzled.<br>\\\"My mistake again. I thought you were saying how sorry you were about my tail, being all numb, and could you do anything to help?\\\"<br>\\\"No,\\\" said Pooh. \\\"That wasn\\'t me,\\\" he said. He thought for a little and then suggested helpfully, \\\"Perhaps it was somebody else.\\\"<br>\\\"Well, thank him for me when you see him.\\\"<br>Pooh looked anxiously at Christopher Robin.<br>\\\"Pooh\\'s found the North Pole,\\\" said Christopher Robin. \\\"Isn\\'t that lovely?\\\"<br>Pooh looked modestly down.<br>\\\"Is that it?\\\" said Eeyore.<br>\\\"Yes,\\\" said Christopher Robin.<br>\\\"Is that what we were looking for?\\\"<br>\\\"Yes,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" said Eeyore. \\\"Well, anyhow- it didn\\'t rain,\\\" he said.<br>They stuck the pole in the ground, and Christopher Robin tied a message on to it.<br>NORTH POLE<br>DISCOVERED BY POOH<br>POOH FOUND IT.<br>Then they all went home again. And I think, but I am not quite sure, that Roo had a hot bath and went straight to bed. But Pooh went back to his own house, and feeling very proud of what he had done, had a little something to revive himself.<br>**NORTH POLE**<br>**DISCOVERED BY POOH**<br>**POOH FOUND IT**<br>CHAPTER IX<br>In Which<br>Piglet Is Entirely Surrounded by Water<br>IT RAINED and it rained and it rained. Piglet told<br>himself that never in all his life, and he was<br>goodness knows how old - three, was it, or four? - never<br>had he seen so much rain. Days and days and days.<br>\\\"If only,\\\" he thought, as he looked out of the<br>window, \\\"I had been in Pooh\\'s house, or Christopher<br>Robin\\'s house, or Rabbit\\'s house when it began to<br>rain, then I should have had Company all this time,<br>instead of being here all alone, with nothing to do<br>except wonder when it will stop.\\\" And he imagined<br>himself with Pooh, saying, \\\"Did you ever see such<br>rain, Pooh?\\\" and Pooh saying, \\\"Isn\\'t it awful,<br>Piglet?\\\" and Piglet saying, \\\"I wonder how it is over<br>Christopher Robin\\'s way\\\" and Pooh saying, \\\"I<br>should think poor old Rabbit is about flooded out by<br>this time.\\\" It would have been jolly to talk like this,<br>and really, it wasn\\'t much good having anything<br>exciting like floods, if you couldn\\'t share them with<br>somebody.<br>For it was rather exciting. The little dry ditches in<br>which Piglet had nosed about so often had become<br>streams, the little streams across which he had<br>splashed were rivers, and the river, between whose<br>steep banks they had played so happily, had sprawled<br>out of its own bed and was taking up so much room e<br>everywhere, that Piglet was beginning to wonder<br>whether it would be coming into his bed soon.<br>\\\"It\\'s a little Anxious,\\\" he said to himself, \\\"to be a<br>Very Small Animal Entirely Surrounded by Water.<br>Christopher Robin and Pooh could escape by<br>Climbing Trees, and Kanga could escape by Jumping, and<br>Rabbit could escape by Burrowing, and Owl could<br>escape by Flying, and Eeyore could escape by - by<br>Making a Loud Noise Until Rescued, and here am I,<br>surrounded by water and I can\\'t do anything.\\\"<br>It went on raining, and every day the water got a<br>little higher, until now it was nearly up to Piglet\\'s<br>window .. . and still he hadn\\'t done anything.<br>\\\"There\\'s Pooh,\\\" he thought to himself. \\\"Pooh<br>hasn\\'t much Brain, but he never comes to any harm.<br>He does silly things and they turn out right. There\\'s<br>Owl. Owl hasn\\'t exactly got Brain, but he Knows<br>Things. He would know the Right Thing to Do when I<br>Surrounded by Water. There\\'s Rabbit. He hasn\\'t<br>Learnt in Books, but he can always Think of a Clever<br>Plan. There\\'s Kanga. She isn\\'t Clever, Kanga isn\\'t,<br>but she would be so anxious about Roo that she<br>would do a Good Thing to Do without thinking<br>about it. And then there\\'s Eeyore. And Eeyore is so<br>miserable anyhow that he wouldn\\'t mind about<br>this. But I wonder what Christopher Robin would<br>do?\\\"<br>Then suddenly he remembered a story which<br>Christopher Robin had told him about a man on a<br>desert island who had written something in a bottle<br>and thrown it in the sea; and Piglet thought that if<br>he wrote something in a bottle and threw it in the<br>water, perhaps somebody would come and rescue<br>him!<br>He left the window and began to search his house,<br>all of it that wasn\\'t under water, and at last he found<br>a pencil and a small piece of dry paper, and a bottle<br>with a cork to it. And he wrote on one side of the<br>paper:<br>HELP<br>PIGLET (ME)<br>and on the other side:<br>IT\\'S ME PIGLET, HELP HELP.<br>Then he put the paper in the bottle, and he corked<br>the bottle up as tightly as he could, and he leant out<br>of his window as far as he could lean without falling<br>in, and he threw the bottle as far as he could throw -<br>splash! - and in a little while it bobbed up again on<br>the water; and he watched it floating slowly away in<br>the distance, until his eyes ached with looking, and<br>sometimes he thought it was the bottle, and<br>sometimes he thought it was just a ripple on the water<br>which he was following, and then suddenly he knew<br>that he would never see it again and that he had done<br>all that he could do to save himself.<br>\\\"So now,\\\" he thought, \\\"somebody else will have<br>to do something, and I hope they will do it soon,<br>because if they don\\'t I shall have to swim, which I<br>can\\'t, so I hope they do it soon.\\\" And then he gave a<br>very long sigh and said, \\\"I wish Pooh were here. It\\'s<br>so much more friendly with two.\\\"<br>When the rain began Pooh was asleep. It rained,<br>and it rained, and it rained, and he slept<br>and he slept and he slept. He had had a tiring day. You remember<br>How he discovered the North Pole; well, he was so<br>proud of this that he asked Christopher Robin if there<br>were any other Poles such as a Bear of Little Brain<br>might discover.<br>\\\"There\\'s a South Pole,\\\" said Christopher Robin,<br>\\\"and I expect there\\'s an East Pole and a West Pole,<br>though people don\\'t like talking about them.\\\"<br>Pooh was very excited when he heard this, and<br>suggested that they should have an Exposition to<br>discover the East Pole, but Christopher Robin had<br>thought of something else to do with Kanga; so Pooh<br>went out to discover the East Pole by himself.<br>Whether he discovered it or not, I forget; but he was<br>so tired when he got home that, in the very middle of<br>his supper, after he had been eating for little more<br>than half-an-hour, he fell fast asleep in his chair, and<br>slept and slept and slept.<br>Then suddenly he was dreaming. He was at the<br>East Pole, and it was a very cold pole with the coldest<br>sort of snow and ice all over it. He had found a<br>beehive to sleep in, but there wasn\\'t room for his legs, so<br>he had left them outside. And Wild Woozles, such as<br>inhabit the East Pole, came and nibbled all the fur off<br>his legs to make nests for their Young. And the more<br>they nibbled, the colder his legs got, until suddenly<br>he woke up with an Ow! - and there he was, sitting in<br>his chair with his feet in the water, and water all<br>round him!<br>He splashed to his door and looked out....<br>\\\"This is Serious,\\\" said Pooh. \\\"I must have an<br>Escape\\\"<br>So he took his largest pot of honey and escaped<br>with it to a broad branch of his tree, well above<br>the water, and then he climbed down again and escaped<br>with another pot ... and when the whole Escape was<br>finished, there was Pooh sitting on his branch,<br>dangling his legs, and there, beside him, were ten pots of<br>honey....<br>Two days later, there was Pooh, sitting on his<br>branch, dangling his legs, and there, beside him,<br>were four pots of honey ....<br>Three days later, there was Pooh, sitting on his<br>branch, dangling his legs, and there, beside him,<br>was one pot of honey....<br>Four days later, there was Pooh ...<br>And it was on the morning of the fourth day that<br>Piglet\\'s bottle came floating past him, and with one<br>loud cry of \\\"Honey!\\\" Pooh plunged into the water,<br>seized the bottle, and struggled back to his tree<br>again.<br>\\\"Bother!\\\" said Pooh, as he he opened it. \\\"All that wet<br>for nothing. What\\'s that bit of paper doing?\\\"<br>He took it out and looked at it.<br>\\\"It\\'s a Missage,\\\" he said to himself, \\\"that\\'s what it<br>is. And that letter is a \\'P,\\' and so is that, and so is that,<br>and \\'P\\' means \\'Pooh,\\' so it\\'s a very important Missage<br>to me, and I can\\'t read it. I must find Christopher<br>Robin or Owl or Piglet, one of those Clever Readers<br>who can read things, and they will tell me what this<br>missage means. Only I can\\'t swim. Bother!\\\"<br>Then he had an idea, and I think that for a Bear of<br>Very Little Brain, it was a good idea. He said to<br>himself:<br>\\\"If a bottle can float, then a jar can float, and if<br>a jar floats, I can sit on the top of it, if it\\'s a very<br>big jar.\\\"<br>So he took his biggest jar, and corked it up. \\\"All<br>boats have to have a name,\\\" he said, \\\"so I shall call<br>mine The Floating Bear.\\\" And with these words he<br>dropped his boat into the water and jumped in<br>after it.<br>For a little while Poof and The Floating Bear were<br>uncertain as to which of them was meant to be on the<br>top, but after trying one or two different positions,<br>they settled down with The Floating Bear underneath<br>and Pooh triumphantly astride it, paddling vigorously<br>with his feet.<br>Christopher Robin lived at the very top of the<br>Forest. It rained, and it rained, and it rained, but the<br>water couldn\\'t come up to his house. It was rather<br>jolly to look down into the valleys and see the water<br>all round him, but it rained so hard that he stayed<br>indoors most of the time, and thought about things.<br>Every morning he went out with his umbrella and put<br>a stick in the place where the water came up to, and<br>every next morning he went out and couldn\\'t see his<br>stick any more, so he put another stick in the place<br>where the water came up to, and then he walked<br>home again, and each morning he had a shorter way<br>to walk than he had had the morning before. On the<br>morning of the fifth day he saw the water all round<br>him, and knew that for the first time in his life he<br>was on a real island. Which was very exciting.<br>It was on this morning that Owl came flying over<br>the water to say \\\"How do you do,\\\" to his friend<br>Christopher Robin.\\\"<br>\\\"I say, Owl,\\\" said Christopher Robin, \\\"isn\\'t this<br>fun? I\\'m on an island!\\\"<br>\\\"The atmospheric conditions hav been very<br>unfavourable lately,\\\" said Owl.<br>\\\"The what?\\\"<br>\\\"It has been raining,\\\" explained Owl.<br>\\\"Yes,\\\" said Christopher Robin. \\\"It has.\\\"<br>\\\"The flood-level has reached an unprecedented<br>height.\\\"<br>\\\"The who?\\\"<br>\\\"There\\'s a lot of water about,\\\" explained Owl.<br>\\\"Yes,\\\" said Christopher Robin, \\\"there is.\\\"<br>\\\"However, the prospects are rapidly becoming<br>more favourable. At any moment - \\\"<br>\\\"Have you seen Pooh?\\\"<br>\\\"No. At any moment -\\\"<br>\\\"I hope he\\'s all right,\\\" said Christopher Robin.<br>\\\"I\\'ve been wondering about him. I expect Piglet\\'s<br>with him. Do you think they\\'re all right, Owl?\\\"<br>\\\"I expect so. You see, at any moment - \\\"<br>\\\"Do go and see, Owl. Do you see, Owl?\\\"<br>\\\"That\\'s all right,\\\" said Owl. \\\"I\\'ll go. Back<br>directly.\\\" And he flew off.<br>In a little while he was back again.<br>\\\"Pooh isn\\'t there,\\\" he said.<br>\\\"Not there?\\\"<br>\\\"Has been there. He\\'s been sitting on a branch of<br>his tree outside his house with nine pots of honey.<br>But he isn\\'t there now.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh, Pooh!\\\" cried Christopher Robin. \\\"Where are<br>you?\\\"<br>\\\"Here I am,\\\" said a growly voice behind him.<br>\\\"Pooh!\\\"<br>They rushed into each other\\'s arms.<br>\\\"How did you get here, Pooh?\\\" asked Christopher<br>Robin, when he was ready to talk again.<br>\\\"On my boat,\\\" said Pooh proudly. \\\"I had a Very<br>Important Missage sent me in a bottle, and owing to<br>having got some water in my eyes, I couldn\\'t read it,<br>so I brought it to you. On my boat.\\\"<br>With these proud words he gave Christopher<br>Robin the missage.<br>\\\"But it\\'s from Piglet!\\\" cried Christopher Robin<br>when he had read it.<br>\\\"Isn\\'t there anything about Pooh in it?\\\" asked<br>Bear, looking over his shoulder.<br>Christopher Robin read the message aloud.<br>\\\"Oh, are those \\'P\\'s\\' Piglets? I thought they were<br>Poohs.\\\"<br>\\\"We must rescue him at once! I thought he was<br>with you, Pooh. Owl, could you rescue him on your<br>back?\\\"<br>\\\"I don\\'t think so,\\\" said Owl, after grave thought.<br>\\\"It is doubtful if the necessary dorsal muscles --\\\"<br>\\\"Then would you fly to him at once and say that<br>Rescue is Coming? And Pooh and I will think of a<br>Rescue and come as quick as ever we can. Oh, don\\'t<br>talk, Owl, go on quick!\\\" And, still thinking of<br>something to say, Owl flew off.<br>\\\"Now, then, Pooh,\\\" said Christopher Robin,<br>\\\"where\\'s your boat?\\\"<br>\\\"I ought to say,\\\" explained Pooh as they walked<br>down to the shore of the island, \\\"that it isn\\'t just an<br>ordinary sort of boat. Sometimes it\\'s a Boat, and<br>sometimes it\\'s more of an Accident. It all depends.\\\"<br>\\\"Depends on what?\\\"<br>\\\"On whether I\\'m on the top of it or underneath<br>it.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh! Well, where is it?\\\"<br>\\\"There!\\\"\\\" said Pooh, pointing proudly to the<br>Floating Bear.<br>It wasn\\'t what Christopher Robin expected, and<br>the more he looked at it, the more he thought what a<br>Brave and Clever Bear Pooh was, and the more<br>Christopher Robin thought this, the more Pooh<br>looked modestly down his nose and tried to pretend<br>he wasn\\'t.<br>\\\"But it\\'s too small for two of us,\\\" said Christopher<br>Robin sadly.<br>\\\"Three of us with Piglet.\\\"<br>\\\"That makes it smaLler still. Oh, Pooh Bear, what<br>shall we do?\\\"<br>And then this Bear, Pooh Bear, Winnie-the-Pooh,<br>F.O.P (Friend of Piglet\\'s), R.C. (Rabbit\\'s<br>Companion), P.D. (Pole Discoverer), E.C. and T.F. (Eeyore\\'s<br>Comforter and Tail-finder)-in fact, Pooh himself -<br>said something so clever that Christopher Robin<br>could only look at him with mouth open and eyes<br>staring, wondering if this was really the Bear of Very<br>Little Brain whom he had known and loved so long.<br>\\\"We might go in your umbrella,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"?\\\"<br>\\\"We might go in your umbrella,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"??\\\"<br>\\\"We might go in your umbrella,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"!!!!!!\\\"<br>For suddenly Christopher Robin saw that they<br>might. He opened his umbrella and put it point<br>downwards in the water . It floated but wobbled.<br>Pooh got in. He was just beginning to say that it was<br>all right now, when he found that it wasn\\'t, so after a<br>short drink which he didn\\'t really want he waded<br>back to Christopher Robin. Then they both got in<br>together, and it wobbled no longer.<br>\\\"I shall call this boat The Brain of Pooh,\\\" said<br>Christopher Robin, and The Brain of Pooh set sail forthwith<br>in a south-westerly direction, revolving gracefully.<br>You can imagine Piglet\\'s joy when at last the ship<br>came in sight of him. In after-years he liked to think<br>that he had been in Very Great Danger during the<br>Terrible Flood, but the only danger he had really<br>been in was in the last half-hour of his imprisonment,<br>when Owl, who had just flown up, sat on a branch of<br>his tree to comfort him, and told him a very long<br>story about an aunt who had once laid a seagull\\'s egg<br>by mistake, and the story went on and on, rather like<br>this sentence, until Piglet who was listening out of his<br>window without much hope, went to sleep quietly<br>and naturally, slipping slowly out of the window<br>towards the water until he was only hanging on by his<br>toes, at which moment luckily, a sudden loud squawk<br>from Owl, which was really part of the story, being<br>what his aunt said, woke the Piglet up and just gave<br>him time to jerk himself back into safety and say,<br>\\\"How interesting, and did she?\\\" when - well, you<br>can imagine his joy when at last he saw the good ship,<br>The Brain of Pooh (Captain, C. Robin; 1st Mate, P.<br>Bear) coming over the sea to rescue him.<br>And that is really the end of the story, and as<br>I am very tired after that last sentence, I think I shall<br>stop there.<br>CHAPTER X<br>In Which<br>Christopher Robin Gives Pooh a Party, and We Say Good-bye<br>ONE DAY when the sun had come back over the Forest, bringing with it the scent of May, and all the streams of the Forest were tinkling happily to find themselves their own pretty shape again, and the little pools lay dreaming of the life they had seen and the big things they had done, and in the warmth and quiet of the Forest the cuckoo was trying over his voice carefully and listening to see if he liked it, and wood-pigeons were complaining gently to themselves in their lazy comfortable way that it was the other fellow\\'s fault, but it didn\\'t matter very much; on such a day as this Christopher Robin whistled in a special way he had, and Owl came flying out of the Hundred Acre Wood to see what was wanted.<br>\\\"Owl,\\\" said Christopher Robin, \\\"I am going to give a party.\\\"<br>\\\"You are, are you?\\\" said Owl.<br>\\\"And it\\'s to be a special sort of party, because it\\'s because of what Pooh did when he did what he did to save Piglet from the flood.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh, that\\'s what it\\'s for, is it?\\\" said Owl.<br>\\\"Yes, so will you tell Pooh as quickly as you can, and all the others, because it will be tomorrow.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh, it will, will it?\\\" said Owl, still being as helpful as possible.<br>\\\"So will you go and tell them, Owl?\\\"<br>Owl tried to think of something very wise to say, but couldn\\'t, so he flew off to tell the others. And the first person he told was Pooh.<br>\\\"Pooh,\\\" he said, \\\"Christopher Robin is giving a party.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" said Pooh. And then seeing that Owl expected him to say something else, he said, \\\"Will there be those little cake things with pink sugar icing?\\\"<br>Owl felt that it was rather beneath him to talk about little cake things with pink sugar icing, so he told Pooh exactly what Christopher Robin had said, and flew off to Eeyore.<br>\\\"A party for Me?\\\" thought Pooh to himself. \\\"How grand!\\\"<br>And he began to wonder if all the other animals would know that it was a special Pooh Party, and if Christopher Robin had told them about The Floating Bear and The Brain of Pooh and all the wonderful ships he had invented and sailed on, and he began to think how awful it would be if everybody had forgotten about it, and nobody quite knew what the party was for; and the more he thought like this, the more the party got muddled in his mind, like a dream when nothing goes right. And the dream began to sing itself over in his head until it became a sort of song. It was an<br>ANXIOUS POOH SONG.<br>3 Cheers for Pooh!<br>(For Who?)<br>For Pooh-<br>(Why what did he do?)<br>I thought you knew;<br>He saved his friend from a wetting!<br>3 Cheers for Bear!<br>(For where?)<br>For Bear-<br>He couldn\\'t swim,<br>But he rescued him!<br>(He rescued who?)<br>Oh, listen, do!<br>I am talking of Pooh-<br>(Of who?)<br>Of Pooh!<br>(I\\'m sorry I keep forgetting.)<br>Well, Pooh was a Bear of Enormous Brain<br>(Just say it again!)<br>Of enormous brain-<br>(Of enormous what?)<br>Well, he ate a lot,<br>And I don\\'t know if he could swim or not,<br>But he managed to float<br>On a sort of boat<br>(On a sort of what?)<br>Well, a sort of pot-<br>So now let\\'s give him three hearty cheers<br>(So now let\\'s give him three hearty whiches?)<br>And hope he\\'ll grow in health and wisdom and riches!<br>3 Cheers for Pooh!<br>(For who?)<br>3 Cheers for Bear!<br>(For where?)<br>For Bear-<br>3 Cheers for the wonderful Winnie-the-Pooh!<br>(Just tell me, Somebody-WHAT DID HE DO?)<br>While this was going on inside him, Owl was talking to Eeyore.<br>\\\"Eeyore,\\\" said Owl, \\\"Christopher Robin is giving a party.\\\"<br>\\\"Very interesting,\\\" say Eeyore. \\\"I suppose they will be sending me down the odd bits which got trodden on. Kind and Thoughtful. Not at all, don\\'t mention it.\\\"<br>\\\"There is an Invitation for you.\\\"<br>\\\"What\\'s that like?\\\"<br>\\\"An Invitation!\\\"<br>\\\"Yes, I heard you. Who dropped it?\\\"<br>\\\"This isn\\'t anything to ear, it\\'s asking you to the party. Tomorrow.\\\"<br>Eeyore shook his head slowly.<br>\\\"You mean Piglet. The little fellow with the excited ears. That\\'s Piglet. I\\'ll tell him.\\\"<br>\\\"No, no!\\\" said Owl, getting quite fussy. \\\"It\\'s you!\\\"<br>\\\"Are you sure?\\\"<br>\\\"Of course I\\'m sure. Christopher Robin said \\'All of them! Tell all of them.\\'\\\"<br>\\\"All of them, except Eeyore?\\\"<br>\\\"All of them,\\\" said Owl sulkily.<br>\\\"Ah!\\\" said Eeyore. \\\"A mistake, no doubt, but still, I shall come. Only don\\'t blame me if it rains.\\\"<br>But it didn\\'t rain. Christopher Robin had made a long table out of some long pieces of wood, and they all sat around it. Christopher Robin sat at one end, and Pooh sat at the other, and between them on one side were Owl and Eeyore and Piglet, and between them on the other side were Rabbit, and Roo and Kanga. And all Rabbit\\'s friends-and-relations spread themselves about on the grass, and waited hopefully in case anybody spoke to them, or dropped anything, or asked them the time.<br>It was the first party to which Roo had ever been, and he was very excited. As soon as ever they had sat down he began to talk.<br>\\\"Hallo, Pooh!\\\" he squeaked.<br>\\\"Hallo, Roo!\\\" said Pooh.<br>Roo jumped up and down in his seat for a little while and then began again.<br>\\\"Hallo, Piglet!\\\" he squeaked.<br>Piglet waved a paw at him, being too busy to say anything.<br>\\\"Hallo, Eeyore!\\\" said Roo.<br>Eeyore nodded gloomily at him. \\\"It will rain soon, you see if it doesn\\'t,\\\" he said.<br>Roo looked to see if it didn\\'t, and it didn\\'t, so he said \\\"Hallo, Owl!\\\"-and Owl said \\\"Hallo, my little fellow,\\\" in a kindly way, and went on telling Christopher Robin about an accident which had nearly happened to a friend of his whom Christopher Robin didn\\'t know, and Kanga said to Roo, \\\"Drink up your milk first, dear, and talk afterwards.\\\"<br>So Roo, who was drinking his milk, tried to say that he could do both at once...¦ and had to be patted on the back and dried for quite a long time afterwards.<br>When they had all nearly eaten enough, Christopher Robin banged on the table with his spoon, and everybody stopped talking and was very silent, except Roo who was just finishing a loud attack of hiccups and trying to look as if it was one of Rabbit\\'s relations.<br>\\\"This party,\\\" said Christopher Robin, \\\"is a party because of what someone did, and we all know who it was, and it\\'s his party, because of what he did, and I\\'ve got a present for him and here it is.\\\" Then he felt about a little and whispered, \\\"Where is it?\\\"<br>While he was looking, Eeyore coughed in an impressive way and began to speak.<br>\\\"Friends,\\\" he said, \\\"including oddments, it is a great pleasure, or perhaps I had better say it has been a pleasure so far, to see you at my party. What I did was nothing. Any of you-except Rabbit and Owl and Kanga-would have done the same. Oh, and Pooh. My remarks do not, of course, apply to Piglet and Roo, because they are too small. Any of you would have done the same. But it just happened to be Me. It was not, I need hardly say, with an idea of getting what Christopher Robin is looking for now\\\"-and he put his front leg to his mouth and said in a loud whisper, \\\"Try under the table\\\"-\\\"that I did what I did-but because I feel that we should all do what we can do to help. I feel that we should all-<br>\\\"H-hup!\\\" said Roo accidentally.<br>\\\"Roo, dear!\\\" said Kanga reproachfully.<br>\\\"Was it me?\\\" asked Roo, a little surprised.<br>\\\"What\\'s Eeyore talking about?\\\" Piglet whispered to Pooh.<br>\\\"I don\\'t know,\\\" said Pooh rather dolefully.<br>\\\"I thought this was your party.\\\"<br>\\\"I thought it was once. But I suppose it isn\\'t.\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'d sooner it was yours than Eeyore\\'s,\\\" said Piglet.<br>\\\"So would I,\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"H-hup!\\\" said Roo again.<br>\\\"AS-I-WAS-SAYING,\\\" said Eeyore loudly and sternly, \\\"as I was saying when I was interrupted by various Loud Sounds, I feel that-\\\"<br>\\\"Here it is!\\\" cried Christopher Robin excitedly. \\\"Pass it down to silly old Pooh. It\\'s for Pooh.\\\"<br>\\\"For Pooh?\\\" said Eeyore.<br>\\\"Of course it is. The best bear in all the world.\\\"<br>\\\"I might have known,\\\" said Eeyore. \\\"After all, one can\\'t complain. I have my friends. Somebody spoke to me only yesterday. And was it last week or the week before that Rabbit bumped into me and said \\'Bother!\\' The Social Round. Always something going on.\\\"<br>Nobody was listening, for they were all saying \\\"Open it Pooh,\\\" \\\"What is it, Pooh?\\\" \\\"I know what it is,\\\" \\\"No, you don\\'t\\\" and other helpful remarks of this sort. And of course Pooh was opening it as quickly as ever he could, but without cutting the string, because you never know when a bit of string might be Useful. At last it was undone.<br>When Pooh saw what it was, he nearly fell down, he was so pleased. It was a Special Pencil Case. There were pencils in it marked \\\"B\\\" for Bear, and pencils marked \\\"HB\\\" for Helping Bear, and pencils marked \\\"BB\\\" for Brave Bear. There was a knife for sharpening the pencils, and india-rubber for rubbing out anything which you had spelt wrong, and a ruler for ruling lines for the words to walk on, and inches marked on the ruler in case you wanted to know how many inches anything was, and Blue Pencils and Red Pencils and Green Pencils for saying special things in blue and red and green. And all these lovely things were in little pockets of their own in a Special Case which shut with a click when you clicked it. And they were all for Pooh.<br>\\\"Oh!\\\" said Pooh.<br>\\\"Oh, Pooh!\\\" said everybody else except Eeyore.<br>\\\"Thank-you,\\\" growled Pooh.<br>But Eeyore was saying to himself, \\\"This writing business. Pencils and what-not. Over-rated, if you ask me. Silly stuff. Nothing in it.\\\"<br>Later on, when they had all said \\\"Good-bye\\\" and \\\"Thank-you\\\" to Christopher Robin, Pooh and Piglet walked home thoughtfully together in the golden evening, and for a long time they were silent.<br>\\\"When you wake up in the morning, Pooh,\\\" said Piglet at last, \\\"what\\'s the first thing you say to yourself?\\\"<br>\\\"What\\'s for breakfast?\\\" said Pooh. \\\"What do you say, Piglet?\\\"<br>\\\"I say, I wonder what\\'s going to happen exciting today?\\\" said Piglet.<br>Pooh nodded thoughtfully.<br>\\\"It\\'s the same thing,\\\" he said.<br>\\\"And what did happen?\\\" asked Christopher Robin.<br>\\\"When?\\\"<br>\\\"Next morning.\\\"<br>\\\"I don\\'t know.\\\"<br>\\\"Could you think and tell me and Pooh sometime?\\\"<br>\\\"If you wanted it very much.\\\"<br>\\\"Pooh does,\\\" said Christopher Robin.<br>He gave a deep sigh, picked his bear up by the leg and walked off to the door, trailing Winnie-the-Pooh behind him. At the door he turned and said \\\"Coming to see me have my bath?\\\"<br>\\\"I might,\\\" I said.<br>\\\"Was Pooh\\'s pencil case any better than mine?\\\"<br>\\\"It was just about the same,\\\" I said.<br>He nodded and went out...¦ and in a moment I heard Winnie-the-Pooh-bump, bump, bump-going up the stairs behind him.","char_name":"POOH"},{"book_id":"L196","text":"WHAT WILL LITTLE BEAR WEAR?<br>It is cold.<br>See the snow.<br>See the snow come down.<br>Little Bear said, \\'Mother Bear,<br>I am cold.<br>See the snow.<br>I want to put something on.\\'<br>So Mother Bear made something<br>for Little Bear.<br>\\'See, Little Bear,\\' she said,<br>\\'I have something for my little bear.<br>Here it is.<br>\\'Put it on your head.\\'<br>\\'Oh,\\' said Little Bear.<br>\\'it is a hat.<br>Hurray!

The turtle was old and the digging was hard for him. \\'I have three questions and I came to ask for your help,\\' Nikolai said.<br>\\'When is the best time to do things? Who is the most important one? What is the right thing to do?\\'<br>Leo listened carefully, but he only smiled.<br>Then he went on with his digging.<br>\\'You must be tired,\\' Nikolai said at last. \\'Let me help you.\\' The turtle gave him his shovel and thanked him.<br>And because it was easier for a young boy to dig than it was for and old<br>Turtle, Nikolai kept on digging until the rows were finished.<br>But just as they finished, the wind blew wildly<br>and rain burst from the darkened clouds.<br>As they moved towards the cottage for shelter,<br>Nikolai suddenly heard a cry for help.<br>Running down the path he found a panda whose leg had<br>been injured by a falling tree.<br>Carefully Nikolai carried her into Leo\\'s house and made a<br>splint for her leg with a stick of bamboo.<br>The storm raged on banging at the doors and windows.<br>The Panda woke up.<br>\\'Where am I,\\' she said, \\'and where is my child?\\'<br>The boy ran out of the cottage and down the path. The roar of the<br>storm was deafening. Pushing around by the howling wind and drenching rain he ran farther into the forest. There he found the panda\\'s child cold<br>and shivering on the ground.<br>The little panda was wet and scared, but alive. Nikolai carried her inside<br>and made her warm and dry. Then he laid her in her mothers\\' arms.<br>Leo smiled when he saw what the boy had done.<br>The next morning, the sun was warm, birds<br>sang, and all was well with the world, The<br>panda\\'s leg was healing nicely, and she<br>thanked Nikolai for saving her baby<br>from the storm.<br>At that moment, Sonya, Gogol and Pushkin<br>arrived to make sure everyone was alright.<br>Nikolai felt great peace within himself. He had wonderful<br>friends. And he had saved the panda and her child. But he<br>also felt disappointed. He still had not found the answers<br>to his three questions. So he asked Leo one more time.<br>The old turtle looked at the boy,<br>\\'But your questions have been answered,\\' he said.<br>\\'They have?\\' asked the boy.<br>\\'Yesterday if you had not stayed to help me dig my garden you wouldn\\'t have heard the panda\\'s cries for help in the storm. Therefore, the most important time was the time you spend digging the garden. The most important one at that moment was me, and the most important thing to do was to help me with my garden.<br>Later when you found the injured panda, the most important time was<br>the time you spent mending her leg and saving her child. The most important ones were the panda and her baby. The most important thing<br>to do was to take care of them and make them safe.<br>Remember then that there is only one important time and that time is now. The most important on is always the one you are with. At the most important<br>thing to do is for the one who is standing at your side. For these, my dear<br>boy, are the answers to what is most important in this world.<br>\\'This is why we are here.\\'<br>**Author\\'s Note<br>Many years ago, I found the three questions mentioned in a book by Thich Nhat Hanh, A Vietnamese Zen Master. When I first read the story, it was if a golden bell in me had struck reminding me that I already knew this tale by heart. Some books are like that and it has happened for me very often with the writer Leo Tolstoy.<br>The original short story is not about a boy with animal friends, but a Czar who is looking for answers to three questions. His adventure was of a different kind. Rather than saving a panda and her child, he unwittingly rescues someone who is trying to harm him. By saving his enemy, he creates a profound connection with another human being. I encourage those readers interesting in sophisticated layers of intrigue to out Leo Tolstoy\\'s original story of the same name.<br>I wanted to tell this story to a young audience,<br>So its form here is somewhat different than Tolstoy\\'s. I hope he would be honored by this telling. I hope it would make him smile.<br>The animal characters borrow their names from many places. Pushkin and Gogol are the names of the famous Russian writers. Sonya was the name of Leo Tolstoy\\'s wife. Nikolai was the name of Leo Tolstoy\\'s brother, and also my son who modeled for the character. Pushkin was modeled for by my dog, Raymond. My daughter Adelaine is the baby panda. And the character Leo is, of course, Tolstoy.<br>Count Leo Tolstoy (1828-1920) Was one of Russia\\'s greatest novelists and<br>one of its most influential moral philosophers and social reformers. He is renowned as the author of War and Peace (1865-1869) and Anna Karenina (1875-1877) and also is an outstanding thinker of the 19th century. His short story, \\'The Three Questions,\\' on which this book is based, was published in 1903.**<br>NA","char_name":"NIKOLAI"},{"book_id":"L200","text":"Vroom!

Where is that lazy mouse?\\\"<br>\\\"Wait a minute. Hold everything. You can\\'t tell your story right here. This is the endpaper. The book hasn\\'t even started yet.\\\"<br>\\\"Who are you? Will you help me plant the wheat?\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'m Jack. I\\'m the narrator. And no, I can\\'t help you plant the wheat. I\\'m a very busy guy trying to put a book together. Now why don\\'t you just disappear for a few pages. I\\'ll call you when I need you.\\\"<br>\\\"But who will help me tell my story? Who will help me draw a picture of the wheat? Who will help me spell \\'the wheat\\'?\\\"<br>\\\"Listen Hen - forget the wheat. Here comes the Title Page!\\\"**<br>**Introduction**<br>**A long time ago, people used to tell magical stories of wonder and enchantment. Those stories were called Fairy Tales. Those stories are not in this book. The stories in this book are almost Fairy Tales. But not quite. The stories in this book are Fairly Stupid Tales. I mean, what else would you call a story like \\\"Goldilocks and the Three Elephants\\\"? This girl walking through the woods smells Peanut Porridge cooking. She decides to break into the Elephants\\' house, eat the porridge, sit in the chairs, and sleep in the beds. But when she gets in the house she can\\'t climb up on Baby Elephant\\'s chair because it\\'s too big. She can\\'t climb up on Mama Elephant\\'s chair because it\\'s much too big. And she can\\'t climb up on Papa Elephant\\'s chair because it\\'s much much too big. So she goes home. The End.<br>And if you don\\'t think that\\'s fairly stupid, you should read \\\"Little Red Running Shorts\\\" or maybe \\\"The Stinky Cheese Man.\\\" In fact, you should definitely go read the stories now, because the rest of this introduction just kind of goes on and on and doesn\\'t really say anything. I stuck it on to the end here so it would fill up the page and make it look like I really knew what I was talking about. So stop now. I mean it. Quit reading. Turn the page. If you read this last sentence, it won\\'t tell you anything.**<br>**SURGEON GENERAL\\'S WARNING: It has been determined that these tales are fairly stupid and probably dangerous to your health.**<br>Chicken Licken<br>Once upon a time Chicken Licken was standing around when a piece of something fell on her head. She wasn\\'t the brightest thing on two legs, so she started running around in circles clucking, \\\"The sky is falling! The sky is falling! We must tell the President!\\\"<br>Chicken Licken ran to her friend Ducky Lucky and clucked, \\\"Ducky Lucky! Ducky Lucky! The sky is falling! The sky is falling! We must tell the President!\\\"<br>\\\"Let\\'s go,\\\" quacked Ducky Lucky.<br>Chicken Licken and Ducky Lucky ran to their friend Goosey Loosey and yelled, \\\"Goosey Loosey! Goosey Loosey! The sky is falling! The sky is falling! We must tell the President!\\\"<br>\\\"Let\\'s go,\\\" honked Goosey Loosey.<br>Chicken Licken, Ducky Lucky, and Goosey Loosey ran to their friend Cocky Locky and yelled, \\\"Cocky Locky! Cocky Locky! The sky is falling! The sky is falling! We must tell the President!\\\"<br>\\\"Let\\'s go,\\\" crowed Cocky Locky.<br>\\\"Wait a minute! Wait a minute!\\\" cried Jack the Narrator. \\\"I forgot the Table of Contents! I forgot the Table of Contents!\\\"<br>\\\"Hey, you\\'re not in this story,\\\" said Chicken Licken.<br>\\\"I know,\\\" said Jack the Narrator. \\\"But I came to warn you. The Table of Contents is -\\\"<br>\\\"The sky is falling! The sky is falling!\\\" clucked Chicken Licken. \\\"We must tell the President!\\\"<br>So Chicken Licken, Ducky Lucky, Goosey Loosey, and Cocky Locky ignored Jack the Narrator and ran off to catch a plane to Washington.<br>Just outside the airport they met Foxy Loxy.<br>\\\"Foxy Loxy! Foxy Loxy! The sky is falling! The sky is falling! We must tell the President!\\\" yelled Chicken Licken, Ducky Lucky, Goosey Loosey, and Cocky Locky.<br>\\\"Well, come with me,\\\" said Foxy Loxy. \\\"I know a shortcut to the airport.\\\"<br>Foxy Loxy led Chicken Licken, Ducky Lucky, Goosey Loosey, and Cocky Locky to his cave. He didn\\'t get to eat them though, because Chicken Licken was almost right.<br>The sky wasn\\'t falling.<br>The Table of Contents was. It fell and squashed everybody. The End.<br>The Princess and the Bowling Ball<br>Once upon a time there was a Prince. And this Prince\\'s dad and mom (the King and Queen) somehow got it into their royal heads that no Princess would be good enough for their boy unless she could feel a pea through one hundred mattresses.<br>So it should come as no surprise that the Prince had a very hard time finding a Princess. Every time he met a nice girl, his mom and dad would pile one hundred mattresses on top of a pea and then invite her to sleep over.<br>When the Princess came down for breakfast, the Queen would ask, \\\"How did you sleep, dear?\\\"<br>The Princess would politely say, \\\"Fine, thank you.\\\"<br>And the King would show her the door.<br>Now this went on for three years. And of course nobody ever felt the pea under one hundred mattresses. Then one day the Prince met the girl of his dreams. He decided he better do something about it. That night, before the Princess went to bed, the Prince slipped his bowling ball under the one hundred mattresses.<br>When the Princess came down for breakfast the next morning, the Queen asked, \\\"How did you sleep, dear?\\\"<br>\\\"This might sound odd,\\\" said the Princess. \\\"But I think you need another mattress. I felt like I was sleeping on a lump as big as a bowling ball.\\\"<br>The King and Queen were satisfied.<br>The Prince and Princess were married.<br>And everyone lived happily, though maybe not completely honestly, ever after. The End.<br>The Really Ugly Duckling<br>Once upon a time there was a mother duck and a father duck who had seven baby ducklings. Six of them were regular-looking ducklings. The seventh was a really ugly duckling.<br>Everyone used to say, \\\"What a nice-looking bunch of ducklings - all except that one. Boy, he\\'s really ugly.\\\"<br>The really ugly duckling heard these people, but he didn\\'t care. He knew that one day he would probably grow up to be a swan and be bigger and look better than anything in the pond.<br>Well, as it turned out, he was just a really ugly duckling. And he grew up to be just a really ugly duck. The End.<br>\\\"I planted the wheat. I watered the wheat. I harvested the wheat. Now do I get to tell my story?\\\" said the Little Red Hen. \\\"Say, what\\'s going on here? Why is that page blank? Is that my page? Where is that lazy dog? Where is that lazy cat? Where is that lazy mouse? How do they expect me to tell the whole story by myself? Where is that lazy narrator? Where is that lazy illustrator? Where is that lazy author?\\\"<br>The Other Frog Prince<br>Once upon a time there was a frog.<br>One day when he was sitting on his lily pad, he saw a beautiful princess sitting by the pond. He hopped in the water, swam over to her, and poked his head out of the weeds.<br>\\\"Pardon me, O beautiful princess,\\\" he said in his most sad and pathetic voice. \\\"I wonder if you could help me.\\\"<br>The princess was about to jump up and run, but she felt sorry for the frog with the sad and pathetic voice.<br>So she asked, \\\"What can I do to help you, little frog?\\\"<br>\\\"Well,\\\" said the frog. \\\"I\\'m not really a frog, but a handsome prince who was turned into a frog by a wicked witch\\'s spell. And the spell can only be broken by the kiss of a beautiful princess.\\\"<br>The princess thought about this for a second, then lifted the frog from the pond and kissed him.<br>\\\"I was just kidding,\\\" said the frog. He jumped back into the pond and the princess wiped the frog slime off her lips. The End.<br>Little Red Running Shorts<br>\\\"Okay, I\\'ve got things running smoothly now,\\\" said Jack the Narrator. \\\"And this next story is even better than the last three. See, it\\'s about this girl who runs very fast and always wears red running shorts. That\\'s where her name comes from, get it? So anyway, this girl is running to her granny\\'s house where she meets a wolf. He tricks her into taking the long way while he takes the shortcut. Now this is the good part because Red runs so fast that she beats the wolf to granny\\'s house. He knocks on the door. Red answers it. And guess what she says? \\'My, what slow feet you have.\\' And that\\'s it. The End. Is that great or what? So sit back, relax, and enjoy - \\'Little Red Running Shorts.\\'\\\"<br>\\\"And now, like I already said - \\'Little Red Running Shorts.\\'\\\"<br>\\\"You just told the whole story,\\\" says Little Red Running Shorts. \\\"We\\'re not going to tell it again.<br>\\\"You can\\'t say that,\\\" says Jack. \\\"You have to start with \\'Once upon a time.\\'\\\"<br>\\\"No way,\\\" says the wolf. \\\"You blew it.\\\"<br>\\\"But you guys are next. Look at the title at the top of the page - \\'Little Red Running Shorts.\\' That\\'s you.\\\"<br>\\\"Let\\'s go, Wolf. We\\'re out of here.\\\"<br>\\\"Wait. You can\\'t do this. Your story is supposed to be three pages long. What do I do when we turn the page?\\\"<br>Jack\\'s Bean Problem<br>\\\"Forget that Hen. Now it\\'s time for the best story in the whole book - my story. Because Once Upon a Time I traded our last cow for three magic beans and...¦ hey, Giant. What are you doing down here? You\\'re wrecking my whole story.\\\"<br>\\\"I DON\\'T LIKE THAT STORY,\\\" said the Giant. \\\"YOU ALWAYS TRICK ME.\\\"<br>\\\"That\\'s the best part,\\\" said Jack.<br>\\\"FEE FI FUM FORY. I HAVE MADE MY OWN STORY.\\\"<br>\\\"Great rhyme, Giant. And I\\'m sure your story is just as good. But there\\'s no room for it. So why don\\'t you climb back up the beanstalk. I\\'ll be up in a few minutes to steal your gold and your singing harp.\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'LL GRIND YOUR BONES TO MAKE MY BREAD.\\\"<br>\\\"I knew you\\'d understand. And there\\'s another little thing that\\'s been bugging me. Could you please stop talking in uppercase letters? It really messes up the page.\\\"<br>\\\"I WILL READ MY STORY NOW,\\\" said the Giant. And he did.<br>Giant Story<br>**THE END**<br>**of the evil Stepmother**<br>**said \\\"I\\'ll HUFF and SNUFF and**<br>**give you three wishes.\\\"**<br>**The beast changed into**<br>**SEVEN DWARVES**<br>**HAPPILY EVER AFTER**<br>**for a spell had been cast by a Wicked Witch**<br>**Once upon a time**<br>\\\"That\\'s your story?\\\" said Jack. \\\"You\\'ve got to be kidding. That\\'s not a Fairly Stupid Tale. That\\'s an Incredibly Stupid Tale. That\\'s an Unbelievably Stupid Tale. That is the Most Stupid Tale I Ever - awwwk!\\\"<br>The Giant grabbed Jack and dragged him to the next page.<br>Jack\\'s Story<br>Once upon a time there was a Giant. The Giant squeezed Jack and said, \\\"TELL ME A BETTER STORY OR I WILL GRIND YOUR BONES TO MAKE MY BREAD. AND WHEN YOUR STORY IS FINISHED, I WILL GRIND YOUR BONES TO MAKE MY BREAD ANYWAY! HO, HO, HO.\\\" The Giant laughed an ugly laugh. Jack thought, \\\"He\\'ll kill me if I do. He\\'ll kill me if I don\\'t. There\\'s only one way to get out of this.\\\" Jack cleared his throat, and then began his story.<br>Cinderumpelstiltskin<br>Or the Girl Who Really Blew It<br>Once upon a time there was a beautiful girl named Cinderella who lived with her wicked stepmother and two ugly stepsisters. These steprelatives were not only wicked and ugly - they also made Cinderella clean the house every day.<br>One day the local prince announced that he was holding a fabulous ball at his castle. Everyone was invited.<br>The stepmother and stepsisters got all dressed up to go. But, as usual, they made Cinderella clean the house, so she didn\\'t have time to get ready. After the stepmother and stepsisters left for the ball, Cinderella sat down and began to cry.<br>Just then a little man appeared.<br>\\\"Please don\\'t cry,\\\" he said. \\\"I can help you spin straw into gold.\\\"<br>\\\"I don\\'t think that will do me much good,\\\" said Cinderella. \\\"I need a fancy dress, glass slippers, and a coach.\\\"<br>\\\"Would you like to try to guess my name?\\\" said the clever little man.<br>Cinderella looked at him. \\\"No. Not really.\\\"<br>\\\"Come on. Do you think it\\'s \\'Chester\\'?\\\"<br>\\\"If you don\\'t have a dress, it doesn\\'t really matter.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh, just guess a name, any name.\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'m not supposed to talk to strangers,\\\" said Cinderella. Then she closed the door and left the little man standing outside screaming, \\\"RUMPELSTILTSKIN! RUMPELSTILTSKIN! RUMPELSTILTSKIN!\\\"<br>When the stepmother and stepsisters got home from the ball, Cinderella told them about the strange little man. They still made her clean the house. And meaner still, they changed her name to Cinderumpelstiltskin. The End.<br>The Tortoise and the Hair<br>Once upon a time there was a Tortoise who was very slow but very dependable.<br>He would always get where he set out to go.<br>It just took him longer than most people.<br>One day Rabbit saw Tortoise walking slowly but surely down the road and said, \\\"Tortoise, you are so slow. I could probably grow hair faster than you run.\\\"<br>\\\"Oh yeah?\\\" said Tortoise slowly.<br>\\\"Yeah,\\\" said Rabbit.<br>So they decided to race.<br>One the day of the big race Tortoise and Rabbit lined up at the starting line.<br>Owl said, \\\"On your mark. Get set. Grow!\\\"<br>Tortoise started to run.<br>Rabbit started to grow his hair.<br>Tortoise ran. Rabbit grew his hair. Tortoise ran. Rabbit grew his hair. Tortoise ran. Rabbit grew his hair. Tortoise ran. Rabbit grew his hair. Tortoise ran. Rabbit grew his hair. Tortoise ran. Rabbit grew his hair. Tortoise is still running. Rabbit is still growing his hair. Not The End.<br>The Stinky Cheese Man<br>Once upon a time there was a little old woman and a little old man who lived together in a little old house. They were lonely. So the little old lady decided to make a man out of stinky cheese. She gave him a piece of bacon for a mouth and two olives for eyes and put him in the oven to cook.<br>When she opened the oven to see if he was done, the smell knocked her back.<br>\\\"Phew! What is that terrible smell?\\\" she cried. The Stinky Cheese Man hopped out of the oven and ran out the door calling, \\\"Run run run as fast as you can. You can\\'t catch me. I\\'m the Stinky Cheese Man!\\\"<br>The little old lady and the little old man sniffed the air.<br>\\\"I\\'m not really very hungry,\\\" said the little old man.<br>\\\"I\\'m not really all that lonely,\\\" said the little old lady. So they didn\\'t chase the Stinky Cheese Man. The Stinky Cheese Man ran and ran until he met a cow eating grass in a field. \\\"Wow! What\\'s that awful smell?\\\" said the cow.<br>The Stinky Cheese Man said, \\\"I\\'ve run away from a little old lady and a little old man and I can run away from you too I can. Run run run as fast as you can. You can\\'t catch me. I\\'m the Stinky Cheese Man!\\\"<br>The cow gave another sniff and said, \\\"I\\'ll bet you could give someone two or three stomachaches. I think I\\'ll just eat weeds.\\\"<br>So the cow didn\\'t chase the stinky cheese man either.<br>The Stinky Cheese Man ran and ran until he met some kids playing outside school.<br>\\\"Gross,\\\" said a little girl. \\\"What\\'s that nasty smell?\\\"<br>\\\"I\\'ve run away from a little old lady, and a little old man, and a cow, and I can run away from you too I can. Run run run as fast as you can. You can\\'t catch me. I\\'m the Stinky Cheese Man!\\\"<br>A little boy looked up, sniffed the air and said, \\\"If we catch him, our teacher will probably make us eat him. Let\\'s get out of here.\\\"<br>So the kids didn\\'t chase the Stinky Cheese Man either.<br>By and by the Stinky Cheese Man came to a river with no bridge.<br>\\\"How will I ever cross this river? It\\'s too big to jump, and if I try to swim across I\\'ll probably fall apart,\\\" said You-Know-Who.<br>Just then the sly fox (who shows up in a lot of stories like these) poked his head out of the bushes.<br>\\\"Why, just hop on my back and I\\'ll carry you across, Stinky Cheese Man.\\\"<br>\\\"How do I know you won\\'t eat me?\\\"<br>\\\"Trust me,\\\" said the fox.<br>So the Stinky Cheese Man hopped on the fox\\'s back.<br>The fox swam to the middle of the river and said, \\\"Oh man! What is that funky smell?\\\"<br>The fox coughed, gagged, and sneezed, and the Stinky Cheese Man flew off his back and into the river where he fell apart.

It was clean. It was neat.<br>The water was warm. There was plenty to eat.<br>The turtles had everything turtles might need.<br>And they were all happy. Quite happy indeed.<br>They were... until Yertle, the king of them all,<br>Decided the kingdom he ruled was too small.<br>\\\"I\\'m ruler\\\", said Yertle, \\\"of all that I see.<br>But I don\\'t see enough. That\\'s the trouble with me.<br>With this stone for a throne, I look down on my pond<br>But I cannot look down on the places beyond.<br>This throne that I sit on is too, too low down.<br>It ought to be higher!\\\" he said with a frown.<br>\\\"If I could sit high, how much greater I\\'d be!<br>What a king! I\\'d be ruler of all that I see!\\\"<br>So Yertle, the Turtle King, lifted his hand<br>And Yertle, the Turtle King, gave a command.<br>He ordered nine turtles to swim to his stone<br>And, using these turtles, he built a new throne.<br>He made each turtle stand on another one\\'s back<br>And he piled them all up in a nine-turtle stack.<br>And then Yertle climbed up. He sat down on the pile.<br>What a wonderful view! He could see \\'most a mile!<br>\\\"All mine!\\\" Yertle cried. \\\"Oh, the things I now rule!<br>I\\'m king of a cow! And I\\'m king of a mule!<br>I\\'m king of a house! And, what\\'s more, beyond that<br>I\\'m king of a blueberry bush and a cat!<br>I\\'m Yertle the Turtle! Oh, marvelous me!<br>For I am the ruler of all that I see!\\\"<br>And all through that morning, he sat there up high<br>Saying over and over, \\\"A great king am I!\\\"<br>Until \\'long about noon. Then he heard a faint sigh.<br>\\\"What\\'s that?\\\" snapped the king<br>And he looked down the stack.<br>And he saw, at the bottom, a turtle named Mack.<br>Just a part of his throne. And this plain little turtle<br>Looked up and he said, \\\"Beg your pardon, King Yertle.<br>\\\"I\\'ve pains in my back and my shoulders and knees.<br>How long must we stand here, Your Majesty, please?\\\"<br>\\\"SILENCE!\\\" the King of the Turtles barked back.<br>\\\"I\\'m king, and you\\'re only a turtle named Mack.\\\"<br>\\\"You stay in your place while I sit here and rule.<br>I\\'m king of a cow! And I\\'m king of a mule!<br>I\\'m king of a house! And a bush! And a cat!<br>But that isn\\'t all. I\\'ll do better than that!<br>My throne shall be higher!\\\" his royal voice thundered,<br>\\\"So pile up more turtles! I want \\'bout two hundred!\\\"<br>\\\"Turtles! More turtles!\\\" he bellowed and brayed.<br>And the turtles \\'way down in the pond were afraid.<br>They trembled. They shook. But they came. They obeyed.<br>From all over the pond, they came swimming by dozens.<br>Whole families of turtles, with uncles and cousins.<br>And all of them stepped on the head of poor Mack.<br>One after another, they climbed up the stack.<br>THEN Yertle the Turtle was perched up so high,<br>He could see forty miles from his throne in the sky!<br>\\\"Hooray!\\\" shouted Yertle. \\\"I\\'m king of the trees!<br>I\\'m king of the birds! And I\\'m king of the bees!<br>I\\'m king of the butterflies! King of the air!<br>Ah, me! What a throne! What a wonderful chair!<br>I\\'m Yertle the Turtle! Oh, marvelous me!<br>For I am the ruler of all that I see!\\\"<br>Then again, from below, in the great heavy stack,<br>Came a groan from that plain little turtle named Mack.<br>\\\"Your Majesty, please... I don\\'t like to complain,<br>But down here below, we are feeling great pain.<br>I know, up on top you are seeing great sights,<br>But down here at the bottom we, too, should have rights.<br>We turtles can\\'t stand it. Our shells will all crack!<br>Besides, we need food. We are starving!\\\" groaned Mack.<br>\\\"You hush up your mouth!\\\" howled the mighty King Yertle.<br>\\\"You\\'ve no right to talk to the world\\'s highest turtle.<br>I rule from the clouds! Over land! Over sea!<br>There\\'s nothing, no, NOTHING, that\\'s higher than me!\\\"<br>But, while he was shouting, he saw with sur prise<br>That the moon of the evening was starting to rise<br>Up over his head in the darkening skies.<br>\\\"What\\'s THAT?\\\" snorted Yertle. \\\"Say, what IS that thing<br>That dares to be higher than Yertle the King?<br>I shall not allow it! I\\'ll go higher still!<br>I\\'ll build my throne higher! I can and I will!<br>I\\'ll call some more turtles. I\\'ll stack \\'em to heaven!<br>I need \\'bout five thousand, six hundred and seven!\\\"<br>But, as Yertle, the Turtle King, lifted his hand<br>And started to order and give the command,<br>That plain little turtle below in the stack,<br>That plain little turtle whose name was just Mack,<br>Decided he\\'d taken enough. And he had.<br>And that plain little lad got a bit mad<br>And that plain little Mack did a plain little thing.<br>He burped!<br>And his burp shook the throne of the king!<br>**BURP!**<br>And Yertle the Turtle, the king of the trees,<br>The king of the air and the birds and the bees,<br>The king of a house and a cow and a mule...<br>Well, that was the end of the Turtle King\\'s rule!<br>For Yertle, the King of all Sala-ma-Sond,<br>Fell off his high throne and fell Plunk! in the pond!<br>And today the great Yertle, that Marvelous he,<br>Is King of the Mud.

It\\'s cold out there, and windy.\\'<br>Irene put on her fleece-lined boots, her red hat and muffler, her heavy coat, and her mittens. She kissed her mother\\'s hot forehead six times, then once again, made sure she was tucked in snugly, and slipped out with the big box, shutting the door firmly behind her.<br>It really was cold outside, very cold. The wind whirled the falling snowflakes about, this way, that way, and into Irene\\'s squinting face. She set out on the uphill path to Farmer Bennett\\'s sheep pasture.<br>By the time she got there, the snow was up to her ankles and the wind was worse. It hurried her along and made her stumble. Irene resented this; the box was problem enough. \\'Easy does it!\\' she cautioned the wind, leaning back hard against it.<br>By the middle of the pasture, the flakes were falling thicker. Now the wind drove Irene along so rudely she had to hop, skip, and go helter-skeltering over the knobby ground. Cold snow sifted into her boots and chilled her feet. She pushed out her lip and hurried on. This was an important errand.<br>When she reached Apple Road, the wind decided to put on a show. It ripped branches from trees and flung them about, swept up and scattered the fallen snow, got in front of Irene to keep her from moving ahead. Irene turned around and pressed on backwards.<br>\\'Go home!\\' the wind squalled. \\'Irene . . . go hooooooome. . .\\'<br>\\'I will do no such thing,\\' she snapped. \\'No such thing, you wicked wind!\\'<br>\\'Go ho-o-ome,\\' the wind yodeled. \\'GO HO-WO-WOME,\\' it shrieked, \\'or else.\\' For a short second, Irene wondered if she shouldn\\'t heed the wind\\'s warning. But no! The gown had to get to the duchess!<br>The wind wrestled her for the package - walloped it, twisted it, shook it, snatched at it. But Irene wouldn\\'t yield. \\'It\\'s my mother\\'s work!\\' she screamed.<br>Then - oh, woe! - the box was wrenched from her mittened grasp and send bumbling along in the snow. Irene went after it.<br>She pounced and took hold, but the ill-tempered wind ripped the box open. The ball gown flounced out and went waltzing through the powdered air with tissue-paper attendants.<br>Irene clung to the empty box and watched the beautiful gown disappear.<br>How could anything so terribly wrong be allowed to happen? Tears froze on her lashes. Her dear mother\\'s hard work, all those days of measuring, cutting, pinning, stitching . . . for this? And the poor duchess! Irene decided she would have to trudge on with just the box and explain everything in person.<br>She went shuffling through the snow. Would her mother understand, she wondered, that it was the wind\\'s fault, not hers? Would the duchess be angry? The wind was howling like a wild animal.<br>Suddenly Irene stepped in a hole and fell over with a twisted ankle. She blamed it on the wind. \\'Keep quiet!\\' she scolded. \\'You\\'ve done enough damage already. You\\'ve spoiled everything! Everything!\\' The wind swallowed up her words.<br>She sat in the snow in great pain, afraid she wouldn\\'t be able to go on. But she managed to get to her feet and start moving. It hurt. Home, where she longed to be, where she and her mother could be warm together, was far behind. It\\'s got to be closer to the palace, she thought. But where any place was in all this snow, she couldn\\'t be sure.<br>She plowed on, dragging furrows with her sore foot. The short winter day was almost done.<br>Am I still going the right way, she wondered. There was no one around to advise her. Whoever else there was in this snow-covered world was far, far away, and safe indoors - even the animals in their burrows. She went plodding on.<br>Soon night took over. She knew in the dark that the muffled snow was still falling - she could feel it. She was cold and alone in the middle of nowhere. Irene was lost.<br>She had to keep moving. She was hoping she\\'d come to a house, any house at all, and be taken in. She badly needed to be in someone\\'s arms. The snow was above her knees now. She shoved her way through it, clutching the empty box.<br>She was asking how long a small person could keep this struggle up, when she realized it was getting lighter. There was a soft glow coming from somewhere below her.<br>She waded toward this glow, and soon was gazing down a long slope at a brightly lit mansion. It had to be the palace!<br>Irene pushed forward with all her strength and - sloosh! thwump! - she plunged downward and was buried. She had fallen off a little cliff. Only her hat and the box in her hands stuck out above the snow.<br>Even if she could call for help, no one would hear her. Her body shook. Her teeth chattered. Why not freeze to death, she thought, and let all these troubles end. Why not? She was already buried.<br>And never see her mother\\'s face again? Her good mother who smelled like fresh-baked bread? In an explosion of fury, she flung her body about to free herself and was finally able to climb up on her knees and look around.<br>How to get down to that glittering palace? As soon as she raised the question, she had the answer.<br>She laid the box down and climbed aboard. But it pressed into the snow and stuck. She tried again, and this time, instead of climbing on, she leaped. The box shot forward, like a sled.<br>The wind raced after Irene but couldn\\'t keep up. In a moment she would be with people again, inside where it was warm. The sled slowed and jerked to a stop on paving stones.<br>The time had come to break the bad news to the duchess. With the empty box clasped to her chest, Irene strode nervously toward the palace.<br>But then her feet stopped moving and her mouth fell open. She stared. Maybe this was impossible, yet there it was, a little way off and over to the right, hugging the trunk of a tree - the beautiful ball gown! The wind was holding it there.<br>\\'Mama!\\' Irene shouted. \\'Mama, I found it!\\'<br>She managed somehow, despite the wind\\'s meddling, to get the gown off the tree and back in its box. And in another moment she was at the door of the palace. She knocked twice with the big brass knocker. The door opened and she burst in.<br>She was welcomed by cheering servants and a delirious duchess. They couldn\\'t believe she had come over the mountain in such a storm, all by herself. She had to tell the whole story, every detail. And she did.<br>Then she asked to be taken right back to her sick mother. But it was out of the question, they said; the road that ran around the mountain wouldn\\'t be cleared till morning.<br>\\'Don\\'t fret, child,\\' said the duchess. \\'Your mother is surely sleeping now. We\\'ll get you there first thing tomorrow.\\'<br>Irene was given a good dinner as she sat by the fire, the moisture steaming off her clothes. The duchess, meanwhile, got into her freshly ironed gown before the guests began arriving in their sleighs.<br>What a wonderful ball it was! The duchess in her new gown was like a bright star in the sky. Irene in her ordinary dress was radiant. She was swept up into dances by handsome aristocrats, who kept her feet off the floor to spare her ankle. Her mother would enjoy hearing all about it.<br>Early the next morning, when snow had long since ceased falling, Mrs. Bobbin woke from a good night\\'s sleep feeling much improved. She hurried about and got a fire going in the cold stove. Then she went to look in on Irene.<br>But Irene\\'s bed was empty! She ran to the window and gazed at the white landscape. No one out there. Snow powder fell from the branch of a tree.<br>\\'Where is my child?\\' Mrs. Bobbin cried. She whipped on her coat to go out and find her.<br>When she pulled the door open, a wall of drift faced her. But peering over it, she could see a horse-drawn sleigh hastening up the path. And seated on the sleigh, between two large footmen, was Irene herself, asleep but smiling.<br>Would you like to hear the rest?<br>Well, there was a bearded doctor in the back of the sleigh. And the duchess had sent Irene\\'s mother a ginger cake with white icing, some oranges and a pineapple, and spice candy of many flavors, along with a note saying how much she cherished her gown, and what a brave and loving person Irene was.<br>Which, of course, Mrs. Bobbin knew. Better than the duchess.","char_name":"IRENE"},{"book_id":"L240","text":"Kindergarten,<br>Here I Come!<br>Kindergarten, here I come...<br>I\\'m checking off the list<br>of everything I need for school.<br>Let\\'s see... what have I missed?<br>Backpack...check<br>Glue stick...check<br>A labeled cubby box.<br>Extra pair of underwear.<br>Extra pair of socks.<br>Crayons...check<br>Scissors...check<br>Mom says I\\'m all set.<br>But wait-there are<br>tons of other stuff<br>I\\'d better not forget!<br>My cuddle bear,<br>my magic wand,<br>my superhero cape,<br>two flashlights, and a tool set,<br>in case I must escape.<br>Huh?

So when Miss Hester received an<br>invitation to visit Eunice she was not surprised to<br>read \\'P.S., Please leave your dog home.\\' On the<br>day of her visit Miss Hester asked young Alan Mitz<br>to stay with Fritz and give his afternoon walk.<br>As soon as Miss Hester left, Fritz ran into the parlor.<br>He loved to chew on the chairs and shake the stuff-<br>ing out of the pillows. But Alan was ready. All<br>morning long he kept Fritz from sinking his sharp<br>little teeth into the furniture. Finally the dog gave<br>up and fell asleep, exhausted. Alan took a nap, too,<br>but first he hid his hat under his shirt, hats being on<br>of Fritz\\'s favorite things to chew.<br>An hour later Alan quickly awoke when Fritz gave<br>him a bite on the nose. The bad-mannered dog was<br>ready for his afternoon walk. Alan fastened Fritz\\'s<br>leash and the dog dragged him out of the house.<br>Walking along, they discovered a small white bridge<br>at the side of the road. Alan decided to let Fritz lead<br>the way across.<br>Some distance beyond the bridge Alan stopped to<br>read a sign. It said: ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY NO<br>DOGS ALLOWED IN THIS GARDEN. At the bottom it<br>was signed: ABDUL GASAZI, RETIRED MAGICIAN.<br>Behind the sign stood a vine-covered wall with an<br>open doorway. Alan took the warning quite seriously.<br>He turned to leave, but as he did, Fritz gave a<br>tremendous tug and snapped right out of his collar.<br>He bolted straight ahead through the open door,<br>with Alan running right behind.<br>\\'Fritz, stop, you bad dog!\\' cried Alan, but the dog<br>simply ignored him. Down shadowed paths and<br>across sunlit lawns they raced, deeper and deeper<br>into the garden. Finally, Alan drew close enough to<br>grab hold of Fritz. But as he reached out he slipped<br>and fell. Fritz barked with laughter as he galloped<br>out of sight. Alan slowly picked himself up. He<br>knew he had to find Fritz before Mr. Gasazi discov-<br>ered him. Bruised and tired, he hurried off in the<br>dog\\'s direction.<br>After a long search Alan was ready to give up. He<br>was afraid he might never find Fritz. But then he<br>came upon fresh dog prints. Slowly he followed<br>Fritz\\'s tracks along a path that led into a forest. The<br>dirt path ended and a brick walk began. There were<br>no more tracks to follow, but Alan was certain that<br>Fritz must be just ahead.<br>Alan started running. In front of him he could see a<br>clearing in the forest. As he came dashing out of the<br>woods he stopped as quickly as if he had run up<br>against a wall. For there, in front of him, stood a<br>truly awesome sight. It was the house of Gasazi.<br>Alan nervously climbed the great stairs, convinced<br>Fritz had come this way and been captured.<br>The boy\\'s heart was pounding when he arrived at<br>the huge door. He took a deep breath and reached<br>for the bell, but before he touched it the door swung<br>open. There, in the shadow of the hallway, stood<br>Gasazi the Great. \\'Greetings, do come in\\' was all<br>that he said.<br>Alan followed Gasazi into a large room. When the<br>magician turned around Alan quickly apologized for<br>letting Fritz into the garden. He politely asked that<br>if Mr. Gasazi had Fritz, would he please give him<br>back? The magician listened carefully and then,<br>smiling, said, \\'Certainly you may have your little<br>Fritzie. Follow me.\\' With those words he went to<br>the door and led Alan back outside.<br>They were walking across the lawn when suddenly<br>Gasazi stopped by a gathering of ducks. He began to<br>speak in a voice that was more like a growl. \\'I<br>detest dogs. They dig up my flowers, they chew on<br>my trees. Do you know what I do to dogs I find in<br>my garden?\\' \\'What?\\' whispered Alan, almost<br>afraid to hear the answer. \\'I TURN THEM INTO<br>DUCKS!\\' bellowed Gasazi. In horror, Alan looked<br>at the birds in front of him. When one duck came<br>forward, Gasazi said, \\'There\\'s your Fritz.\\' Alan<br>begged the magician to change Fritz back. \\'Impos-<br>sible,\\' he answered, \\'only time can do that. This<br>spell may last years or perhaps just a day. Now take<br>your dear bird and please don\\'t come again.\\'<br>When Alan took the bird in his arms it tried to give<br>him a bite. \\'Good old boy,\\' said Alan sadly as he<br>patted the bird on the head. \\'You really haven\\'t<br>changed so much.\\' With tears in his eyes he started<br>for home. Behind him Alan could hear Gasazi<br>laughing. As he approached the stairway, a gust of<br>wind took Alan\\'s hat sailing right off his head. Run-<br>ning along with one arm reaching for the hat, Alan<br>lost his hold on Fritz. The duck flew out ahead and<br>grabbed the hat in midair. But instead of landing he<br>just kept on flying, higher and higher, until he disap-<br>peared in the afternoon clouds.<br>Alan just stood and stared at the empty sky. \\'Good-<br>bye, old fellow,\\' he called out sadly, sure that Fritz<br>was gone forever. At least he had something to chew<br>on. Slowly, one step after another, Alan found his<br>way back to the garden gate and over the bridge. It<br>was sunset by the time he reached Miss Hester\\'s.<br>Lights were on and he knew she must be home.<br>With a heavy heart he approached the door, wonder-<br>ing how Miss Hester would take the news.<br>When Miss Hester came to the door Alan blurted<br>out his incredible story. He could barely hold back<br>the tears; then, racing out of the kitchen, dog food on<br>his nose, came Fritz. Alan couldn\\'t believe his eyes.<br>\\'I\\'m afraid Mr. Gasazi played a trick on you,\\' said<br>Miss Hester, trying to hide a smile. \\'Fritz was in the<br>front yard when I returned. He must have found his<br>own way home while you were with Mr. Gasazi. You<br>see, Alan, no one can really turn dogs into ducks;<br>that old magician just made you think that duck was<br>Fritz.<br>Alan felt very silly. He promised himself he\\'d never<br>be fooled like that again. He was too old to believe<br>in magic. Miss hester watched from the porch as<br>Alan waved goodbye and hurried down the road to<br>go home. Then she called out to Fritz, who was<br>playfully running around the front yard. He came<br>trotting up the front steps with something in his<br>mouth and dropped it at Miss Hester\\'s feet. \\'Why<br>you bad dog,\\' she said. \\'What are you doing with<br>Alan\\'s hat?\\'","char_name":"ALAN"},{"book_id":"L248","text":"TUESDAY EVENING, AROUND EIGHT.<br>11:21 P.M.<br>4:38 A.M<br>NEXT TUESDAY 7:58 P.M"},{"book_id":"L250","text":"**Today<br>I will<br>Fly!**<br>Today I will fly!<br>No.<br>You will not fly today.<br>You will not fly<br>tomorrow.<br>You will not fly<br>next week.<br>YOU WILL<br>NEVER FLY!<br>I will try.<br>Good-bye.<br>YOU WILL<br>NOT FLY!<br>She will not fly.<br>Fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly, fly!<br>Fly, fly, fly, fly!<br>You need help.<br>Thank you.<br>I do need help!<br>I will get help!<br>WOOF!<br>WOOF!<br>WOOF!<br>WOOF!<br>WOOF!<br>WOOF!<br>I did it!<br>I flew!<br>Thank you for your help!<br>You did not fly.<br>I did not fly?<br>YOU JUMPED!<br>I jumped?<br>It was a big jump!<br>Yes, it was a big jump.<br>But you did not fly.<br>I will try again!<br>I will eat lunch.<br>Good-bye!<br>Fly!

woman<br>who lived alone in the country with<br>her three children, Shang, Tao, and<br>Paotze. On the day of their grand-<br>mother\\'s birthday, the good mother<br>set off to see her, leaving the three<br>children at home.<br>Before she left, she said, \\\"Be good<br>while I am away, my heart-loving<br>children. I will not return tonight.<br>Remember to close the door tight at<br>sunset and latch it well.\\\"<br>But an old wolf lived nearby and<br>saw he good mother leave. At dusk,<br>disguised as an old woman, he<br>came up to the house of the children<br>and knocked on the door twice:<br>bang, bang.<br>Shang, who was the eldest, said<br>through the latched door, \\\"Who is<br>it?\\\"<br>\\\"My little jewels,\\\" said the wolf,<br>\\\"this is your grandmother, your Po<br>Po.\\\"<br>\\\"Po Po!\\\" Shang said. \\\"Our mother<br>has gone to visit you!\\\"<br>The wolf acted surprised. \\\"To<br>visit me? I have not met her along<br>the way. She must have taken a<br>different route.\\\"<br>\\\"Po Po!\\\" Shang said. \\\"How is it<br>that you come so late?\\\"<br>The wolf answered. \\\"The journey<br>is long, my children, and the day is<br>short.\\\"<br>Shang listened through the door<br>\\\"Po Po,\\\" she said, \\\"why is your<br>voice so low?\\\"<br>\\\"Your grandmother has caught a<br>cold, good children, and it is dark<br>and windy out here. Quickly open<br>up, and let your Po Po come in,\\\" the<br>cunning wolf said.<br>Tao and Paotze could not wait.<br>One unlatched the door and the<br>other opened it. They shouted, \\\"Po<br>Po, Po Po, come in!\\\"<br>At the moment he entered the<br>door, the wolf blew out the candle.<br>\\\"Po Po,\\\" Shang asked, \\\"why did<br>you blow out the candle? The room<br>is now dark.\\\"<br>The wolf did not answer.<br>Tao and Paotze rushed to their Po<br>Po and wished to be hugged. The old<br>wolf held Tao. \\\"Good child, you are<br>so plump.\\\" He embraced Paotze.<br>\\\"Good child, you have grown to be<br>so sweet.\\\"<br>Soon the old wolf pretended to be<br>sleepy. He yawned. \\\"All the chicks<br>are in the coop,\\\" he said. \\\"Po Po is<br>sleepy too.\\\" When he climbed into<br>the big bed, Paotze climbed in at one<br>end with the wolf, and Shang and<br>Tao climbed in at the other.<br>But when Shang stretched, she<br>touched the wolf\\'s tail. \\\"Po Po, P<br>Po, your foot has a bush on it.\\\"<br>\\\"Po Po has brought hemp strings to<br>weave you a basket,\\\" the wolf said.<br>Shang touched grandmother\\'s<br>sharp claws. \\\"Po Po, Po Po, your<br>hand has thorns on it.\\\"<br>\\\"Po Po has brought an awl to<br>make shoes for you,\\\" the wolf said.<br>At once, Shang lit the light and<br>the wolf blew it out again, but Shang<br>had seen the wolf\\'s hairy face.<br>\\\"Po Po, Po Po,\\\" she said, for she<br>was not only the eldest, she was the<br>most clever, \\\"you must be hungry.<br>Have you eaten gingko nuts?\\\"<br>\\\"What is gingko?\\\" the wolf asked.<br>\\\"Gingko is soft and tender, like<br>the skin of a baby. One taste and you<br>will live forever,\\\" Shang said, \\\"and<br>the nuts grow on the top of the tree<br>just outside the door.\\\"<br>The wolf gave a sigh. \\\"Oh, dear.<br>Po Po is old, her bones have become<br>brittle. No longer can she climb<br>trees.\\\"<br>\\\"Good Po Po, we can pick some<br>for you,\\\" Shang said.<br>The wolf was delighted.<br>Shang jumped out of bed and Tao<br>and Paotze came with her to the<br>gingko tree. there, Shang told her<br>sisters about the wolf and all three<br>climbed up the tall tree.<br>The wolf waited and waited.<br>Plump Tao did not come back.<br>Sweet Paotze did not come back.<br>Shang did not come back, and no<br>one brought any nuts from the<br>gingko tree. At last the wolf shouted,<br>\\\"Where are you, children?\\\"<br>\\\"Po Po,\\\" Shang called out, \\\"we<br>are on the top of the tree eating<br>gingko nuts.\\\"<br>\\\"Good children,\\\" the wolf begged,<br>\\\"pluck some for me.\\\"<br>\\\"But Po Po, gingko is magic only<br>when it is plucked directly from the<br>tree. You must come and pluck it<br>from the tree yourself.\\\"<br>The wolf came outside and paced<br>back and forth under the tree where<br>he heard the three children eating<br>the gingko nuts at the top. \\\"Oh, Po<br>Po, these nuts are so tasty! The skin<br>so tender,\\\" Shang said. The wolf\\'s<br>mouth began to water for a taste.<br>Finally, Shang the eldest and<br>most clever child, said, \\\"Po Po, Po<br>Po, I have a plan. At the door there<br>is a big basket. Behind it is a rope.<br>Tie the rope to the basket, sit in the<br>basket and throw the other end to<br>me. I can pull you up.\\\"<br>The wolf was overjoyed and<br>fetched the basket and the rope, then<br>threw one end of the rope to the top<br>of the tree. Shang caught the rope<br>and began to pull the basket up and<br>up.<br>Halfway she let go of the rope, and<br>the basket and the wolf fell to the<br>ground.<br>\\\"I am so small and weak. Po Po.\\\"<br>Shang pretended. \\\"I could not hold<br>the rope alone.\\\"<br>\\\"This time I will help,\\\" Tao said.<br>\\\"Let us do it again.\\\"<br>The wolf had only one thought in<br>his mind: to taste a gingko nut. He<br>climbed into the basket again. Now<br>Shang and Tao pulled the rope on<br>the basket together, higher and<br>higher.<br>Again, they let go, and again the<br>wolf tumbled down, down, and<br>bumped his head.<br>The wolf was furious. He growled<br>and cursed. \\\"We could not hold the<br>rope, Po Po,\\\" Shang said, \\\"but only<br>one gingko nut and you will be well<br>again.\\\"<br>\\\"I shall give a hand to my sisters<br>this time.\\\" Paotze, the youngest,<br>said, \\\"this time we shall not fail.\\\"<br>Now the children pulled the rope<br>with all of their strength. As they<br>pulled they sang, \\\"Hei yo, hei yo,\\\"<br>and the basket rose straight up,<br>higher than the first time, higher<br>than the second time, higher and<br>higher and higher until it nearly<br>reached the top of the tree. When the<br>wolf reached out, he could almost<br>touch the highest branch.<br>But at that moment, Shang<br>coughed and they all let go of the<br>rope, and the basket fell down and<br>down and down. Not only did the<br>wolf bump his head, but he broke<br>his heart to pieces.<br>\\\"Po Po,\\\" Shang shouted, but there<br>was no answer.<br>\\\"Po Po,\\\" Tao shouted, but there<br>was no answer.<br>\\\"Po Po,\\\" Paotze shouted. There<br>was still no answer. The children<br>climbed to the branches just above<br>the wolf and saw that he was truly<br>dead. then they climbed down,<br>went into the house, closed the door,<br>locked the door with the latch and<br>fell peacefully asleep.<br>On the next day, their mother<br>returned with baskets of food from<br>their real Po Po, and the three sisters<br>told her the story of the Po Po who<br>had come."},{"book_id":"L257","text":"The wheels on the bus go round and round<br>**Round and Round**<br>The wheels on the bus go round and round All over town.<br>The doors<br>on the bus<br>go<br>open and shut<br>OPEN<br>and<br>SHUT<br>OPEN and SHUT<br>The doors<br>on the bus go<br>OPEN and SHUT<br>All over town<br>The people<br>on the bus<br>step out<br>and in<br>OUT<br>and IN<br>OUT and IN<br>The people<br>on the bus<br>step out and in<br>All over town<br>The driver<br>on the bus<br>says,<br>\\'Move on back!<br>Move on back!<br>Move on back!\\'<br>All over town<br>The windows on the bus slide<br>up and down up and down<br>The windows on the bus slide up and down<br>All over town<br>The wipers **swish swish swish** on the bus go **swish swish swish** swish swish swish<br>The wipers<br>on the bus<br>go swish swish swish<br>All over town<br>The riders on the bus go bumpety-bump<br>bumpety-bump bumpety-bump<br>The riders on the bus go bumpety-bump<br>All over town<br>The babies on the bus cry WAAH!
