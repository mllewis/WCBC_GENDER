their good old bulldog Jack.<br>Winter was coming to the Big Woods.<br>Soon the little house would be covered with snow.<br>Pa went hunting every day so that they would have meat during the long, cold winter.<br>Ma, Laura, and Mary gathered potatoes and carrots, beets and turnips, cabbages and onions, and peppers and pumpkins from the garden next to the little house.<br>By the time winter came, the little house was full of good things to eat.<br>Laura and Mary thought the attic was a lovely place to play.<br>They played house by using the round orange pumpkins as tables and chairs, and everything was snug and cozy.<br>Soon the first snow came, and it was very cold.<br>In the mornings the windows were covered with beautiful frost pictures of trees and flowers and fairies.<br>Ma said that Jack Frost came in the night and made the pictures while everyone was asleep.<br>Laura and Mary were allowed to use Ma\\'s thimble to make pretty patterns of circles in the frost.<br>In the mornings Laura and Mary helped Ma wash the dishes and make the beds.<br>After this was done, Ma began the work that belonged to that day.<br>Each day had its own proper work.<br>Ma would say<br>Wash on Monday, Iron on Tuesday, mend on Wednesday, churn on Thursday, clean on Friday, bake on Saturday, rest on Sunday.<br>Laura liked the churning and baking days best of all.<br>Ma had to churn the cream for a long time until it turned into butter.<br>Mary could sometimes churn while Ma rested, but Laura was too little.<br>On Saturdays, when Ma made the bread, Laura and Mary each had a little piece of dough to make into a little loaf.<br>Ma even gave them a bit of cookie dough to make little cookies.<br>After the day\\'s work was done, Ma would sometimes cut out paper dolls for Laura and Mary.<br>She drew their faces on with a pencil, and cut dresses, hats, and ribbons out of colored paper so that Mary and Laura could dress their dolls beautifully.<br>But the best time of all was at night, when Pa came home.<br>He would throw off his fur cap and coat and mittens and call, Where\\'s my little half-pint of sweet cider half drunk up?<br>That was Laura, because she was so small.<br>Sometimes Pa would take down his fiddle and sing.<br>Pa would keep time with his foot.<br>Laura and Mary would clap their hands to the music when he sang:<br>Yankee Doodle went to town, He wore his striped trousies, he swore he couldn\\'t see the town, there was so many houses.<br>Other times Pa would tell stories.<br>When Laura and Mary begged him for a story, he would take them on his knees and tickle their faces with his long whiskers until they laughed out loud.<br>His eyes were blue and merry.<br>Outside it was cold and snowy, but the little log cabin was snug and cozy.<br>Pa,
