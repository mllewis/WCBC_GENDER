Lucy smeared ketchup on her toast.

It doesn\'t mean one person is<br>right or wrong. We\'re all different. What a boring world it would be if we were<br>all exactly alike! Do you remember what\'s really important?\' Papa Gino asked.<br>\'Yes, Papa. Even if we are different from others on the outside, we all have a<br>heart with feelings on the inside.\'<br>\'That\'s my girl! Remember, when you treat others with love and kindness, you<br>are doing the right thing,\' Pap Gino replied.<br>On the school bus, Lucy and her friend Harriet pulled out some paper and<br>crayons. Sitting across from them was Ralph. As usual, Ralph sat alone, staring<br>out the window. He looked over at them and rolled his eyes.<br>In the classroom, Lucy sat down near the teacher. Miss Marcia waited to begin<br>as the children settled into their seats. Ralph carelessly hurried over and tripped<br>on Lucy\'s foot. Before long, he was glaring at her.<br>Ralph whispered, \'Woof! I can\'t see the book with this poodle in front of<br>me.\' Lucy could hear him giggling behind her. Oh no, why did it have to be<br>me? She wondered.<br>**Friendship week: share a smile!**<br>During lunch, Harriet shouted one of her silly jokes over the other children\'s<br>voices. As the girls ate, their bellies shook with laughter.<br>Across the table, Ralph hollered, \'Yuck. That\'s the disgusting smell.<br>Whoever heard of eating spaghetti in a hot dog bun? Don\'t you think<br>that\'s gross, Tony?\'<br>Tony and the other children at the table turned away from Ralph, shaking their<br>heads. Ralph continued, \'Poor little Lucy with her hair so poofy!\' Tears filled<br>Lucy\'s eyes, and she began to cry.<br>On the way home, Lucy thought about what had happened. Maybe Ralph is mean<br>to me because he thinks being different is bad. I wish he would stop teasing me.<br>Slowly, Lucy stepped off the bus. \'How was your day?\' Papa Gino asked.<br>\'Fine,\' she mumbled. Papa reached over and pulled a crayon out of her hair.<br>\'How did this happen?\' he asked. Lucy didn\'t say a word.<br>That night, as Papa Gino tucked Lucy into bed, he asked, \'Is everything all<br>right at school?\' Lucy rolled over. He leaned down, kissed her on the cheek,<br>and whispered, \'Always remember, Papa is<br>here for you. If something\'s not right, we<br>can work on fixing it together.\'<br>It\'s not that easy, thought Lucy. How do I<br>stop Ralph from teasing me? How can he<br>have a heart and be so mean?<br>Lucy had a hard time falling asleep, worrying what would happen tomorrow.<br>The following day, Lucy was surprised to find Ralph leaving her alone, until...<br>\'Lucy, I\'m sorry about yesterday,\' Ralph snickered. Lucy took the bag Ralph<br>handed her. Inside were dog bones and a picture with a note that read:<br>Lucy, Lucy, eats stinky food that puts us in a big, bad mood.<br>Lucy, Lucy, hair shaped like a cone, here\'s a treat for you-<br>a yummy dog bone!<br>The beating of Lucy\'s heart was so loud she knew everyone around her could<br>hear it.

It<br>hurts my feelings when you do this, Ralph,\' Lucy said. \'Please stop!\' Ralph<br>turned and walked away.<br>It was recess time, and Lucy played alone. She didn\'t want to tell Miss Marcia<br>about Ralph. She was afraid of being a tattletale. Lucy wished Papa Gino was<br>there to help. What should I do? she asked herself over and over. The bell<br>rang as recess ended.<br>\'Heeeeelllllppppp!\' cried a child off in the distance. Tony ran up and yelled,<br>\'Ralph got himself stuck at the top of the monkey bars. It\'s the funniest thing<br>I\'ve ever seen!\'<br>\'This is my chance, I\'ll go tell Ralph how mean he really is-M-E-A-N, mean!\'<br>Lucy said under her breath. She stomped off toward the monkey bars.<br>When she reached Ralph, Lucy paused. She looked him in the eye and said,<br>\'What you did was so mean!\' Standing before Ralph, Lucy could hear her<br>papa\'s words. Ralph did have a heart with feelings.<br>In that moment, she decided what she would do. Lucy<br>started to climb up the monkey bars. She saw tears<br>in Ralph\'s eyes. He hesitated to move and whispered,<br>\'I\'m scared.\' Lucy reached for him and said, \'Here,<br>take my hand,\' and she helped him down.<br>The two walked back to the classroom without saying a word.<br>On the way home, Lucy sang songs with Harriet. As the bus pulled up to her<br>stop, Ralph suddenly reached over and handed her a picture. Lucy was<br>amazed by what she saw. \'Thanks,\' she muttered softly.<br>After she got off the bus, Lucy reached for her papa\'s hand and said,<br>\'Papa, there\'s this boy Ralph who was really mean to me.<br>Today he was in trouble, and I helped him.\'<br>Papa Gino hugged Lucy and replied, \'That took a lot of courage. It wasn\'t the<br>easiest thing to do. You chose to be a good person and to treat others the way<br>you want to be treated. I\'m so proud of you, Lucy.\'<br>As they walked home, she asked him what was for dinner.

I feel sick.\'<br>\'Poor Mama,\' said Irene. \'I can get it there!\'<br>\'No, cupcake, I can\'t let you,\' said Mrs. Bobbin. \'Such a huge package, and it\'s such a long way to the palace. Besides, it\'s starting to snow.<br>\'But I love snow,\' Irene insisted. She coaxed her mother into bed, covered her with two quilts, and added a blanket for her feet. Then she fixed her some tea with lemon and honey and put more wood in the stove.<br>With great care, Irene took the splendid gown down from the dummy and packed it in a big box with plenty of tissue paper.<br>\'Dress warmly, pudding,\' her mother called in a weak voice, \'and don\'t forget to button up. It\'s cold out there, and windy.\'<br>Irene put on her fleece-lined boots, her red hat and muffler, her heavy coat, and her mittens. She kissed her mother\'s hot forehead six times, then once again, made sure she was tucked in snugly, and slipped out with the big box, shutting the door firmly behind her.<br>It really was cold outside, very cold. The wind whirled the falling snowflakes about, this way, that way, and into Irene\'s squinting face. She set out on the uphill path to Farmer Bennett\'s sheep pasture.<br>By the time she got there, the snow was up to her ankles and the wind was worse. It hurried her along and made her stumble. Irene resented this; the box was problem enough. \'Easy does it!\' she cautioned the wind, leaning back hard against it.<br>By the middle of the pasture, the flakes were falling thicker. Now the wind drove Irene along so rudely she had to hop, skip, and go helter-skeltering over the knobby ground. Cold snow sifted into her boots and chilled her feet. She pushed out her lip and hurried on. This was an important errand.<br>When she reached Apple Road, the wind decided to put on a show. It ripped branches from trees and flung them about, swept up and scattered the fallen snow, got in front of Irene to keep her from moving ahead. Irene turned around and pressed on backwards.<br>\'Go home!\' the wind squalled. \'Irene . . . go hooooooome. . .\'<br>\'I will do no such thing,\' she snapped. \'No such thing, you wicked wind!\'<br>\'Go ho-o-ome,\' the wind yodeled. \'GO HO-WO-WOME,\' it shrieked, \'or else.\' For a short second, Irene wondered if she shouldn\'t heed the wind\'s warning. But no! The gown had to get to the duchess!<br>The wind wrestled her for the package - walloped it, twisted it, shook it, snatched at it. But Irene wouldn\'t yield. \'It\'s my mother\'s work!\' she screamed.<br>Then - oh, woe! - the box was wrenched from her mittened grasp and send bumbling along in the snow. Irene went after it.<br>She pounced and took hold, but the ill-tempered wind ripped the box open. The ball gown flounced out and went waltzing through the powdered air with tissue-paper attendants.<br>Irene clung to the empty box and watched the beautiful gown disappear.<br>How could anything so terribly wrong be allowed to happen? Tears froze on her lashes. Her dear mother\'s hard work, all those days of measuring, cutting, pinning, stitching . . . for this? And the poor duchess! Irene decided she would have to trudge on with just the box and explain everything in person.<br>She went shuffling through the snow. Would her mother understand, she wondered, that it was the wind\'s fault, not hers? Would the duchess be angry? The wind was howling like a wild animal.<br>Suddenly Irene stepped in a hole and fell over with a twisted ankle. She blamed it on the wind. \'Keep quiet!\' she scolded. \'You\'ve done enough damage already. You\'ve spoiled everything! Everything!\' The wind swallowed up her words.<br>She sat in the snow in great pain, afraid she wouldn\'t be able to go on. But she managed to get to her feet and start moving. It hurt. Home, where she longed to be, where she and her mother could be warm together, was far behind. It\'s got to be closer to the palace, she thought. But where any place was in all this snow, she couldn\'t be sure.<br>She plowed on, dragging furrows with her sore foot. The short winter day was almost done.<br>Am I still going the right way, she wondered. There was no one around to advise her. Whoever else there was in this snow-covered world was far, far away, and safe indoors - even the animals in their burrows. She went plodding on.<br>Soon night took over. She knew in the dark that the muffled snow was still falling - she could feel it. She was cold and alone in the middle of nowhere. Irene was lost.<br>She had to keep moving. She was hoping she\'d come to a house, any house at all, and be taken in. She badly needed to be in someone\'s arms. The snow was above her knees now. She shoved her way through it, clutching the empty box.<br>She was asking how long a small person could keep this struggle up, when she realized it was getting lighter. There was a soft glow coming from somewhere below her.<br>She waded toward this glow, and soon was gazing down a long slope at a brightly lit mansion. It had to be the palace!<br>Irene pushed forward with all her strength and - sloosh! thwump! - she plunged downward and was buried. She had fallen off a little cliff. Only her hat and the box in her hands stuck out above the snow.<br>Even if she could call for help, no one would hear her. Her body shook. Her teeth chattered. Why not freeze to death, she thought, and let all these troubles end. Why not? She was already buried.<br>And never see her mother\'s face again? Her good mother who smelled like fresh-baked bread? In an explosion of fury, she flung her body about to free herself and was finally able to climb up on her knees and look around.<br>How to get down to that glittering palace? As soon as she raised the question, she had the answer.<br>She laid the box down and climbed aboard. But it pressed into the snow and stuck. She tried again, and this time, instead of climbing on, she leaped. The box shot forward, like a sled.<br>The wind raced after Irene but couldn\'t keep up. In a moment she would be with people again, inside where it was warm. The sled slowed and jerked to a stop on paving stones.<br>The time had come to break the bad news to the duchess. With the empty box clasped to her chest, Irene strode nervously toward the palace.<br>But then her feet stopped moving and her mouth fell open. She stared. Maybe this was impossible, yet there it was, a little way off and over to the right, hugging the trunk of a tree - the beautiful ball gown! The wind was holding it there.<br>\'Mama!\' Irene shouted. \'Mama, I found it!\'<br>She managed somehow, despite the wind\'s meddling, to get the gown off the tree and back in its box. And in another moment she was at the door of the palace. She knocked twice with the big brass knocker. The door opened and she burst in.<br>She was welcomed by cheering servants and a delirious duchess. They couldn\'t believe she had come over the mountain in such a storm, all by herself. She had to tell the whole story, every detail. And she did.<br>Then she asked to be taken right back to her sick mother. But it was out of the question, they said; the road that ran around the mountain wouldn\'t be cleared till morning.<br>\'Don\'t fret, child,\' said the duchess. \'Your mother is surely sleeping now. We\'ll get you there first thing tomorrow.\'<br>Irene was given a good dinner as she sat by the fire, the moisture steaming off her clothes. The duchess, meanwhile, got into her freshly ironed gown before the guests began arriving in their sleighs.<br>What a wonderful ball it was! The duchess in her new gown was like a bright star in the sky. Irene in her ordinary dress was radiant. She was swept up into dances by handsome aristocrats, who kept her feet off the floor to spare her ankle. Her mother would enjoy hearing all about it.<br>Early the next morning, when snow had long since ceased falling, Mrs. Bobbin woke from a good night\'s sleep feeling much improved. She hurried about and got a fire going in the cold stove. Then she went to look in on Irene.<br>But Irene\'s bed was empty! She ran to the window and gazed at the white landscape. No one out there. Snow powder fell from the branch of a tree.<br>\'Where is my child?\' Mrs. Bobbin cried. She whipped on her coat to go out and find her.<br>When she pulled the door open, a wall of drift faced her. But peering over it, she could see a horse-drawn sleigh hastening up the path. And seated on the sleigh, between two large footmen, was Irene herself, asleep but smiling.<br>Would you like to hear the rest?<br>Well, there was a bearded doctor in the back of the sleigh. And the duchess had sent Irene\'s mother a ginger cake with white icing, some oranges and a pineapple, and spice candy of many flavors, along with a note saying how much she cherished her gown, and what a brave and loving person Irene was.<br>Which, of course, Mrs. Bobbin knew. Better than the duchess.","char_name":"IRENE"},{"book_id":"L247","text":"Six times Miss Hester\'s dog Fritz had bitten dear<br>cousin Eunice.

Alan decided to let Fritz lead<br>the way across.<br>Some distance beyond the bridge Alan stopped to<br>read a sign. It said: ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY NO<br>DOGS ALLOWED IN THIS GARDEN. At the bottom it<br>was signed: ABDUL GASAZI, RETIRED MAGICIAN.<br>Behind the sign stood a vine-covered wall with an<br>open doorway. Alan took the warning quite seriously.<br>He turned to leave, but as he did, Fritz gave a<br>tremendous tug and snapped right out of his collar.<br>He bolted straight ahead through the open door,<br>with Alan running right behind.<br>\'Fritz, stop, you bad dog!\' cried Alan, but the dog<br>simply ignored him. Down shadowed paths and<br>across sunlit lawns they raced, deeper and deeper<br>into the garden. Finally, Alan drew close enough to<br>grab hold of Fritz. But as he reached out he slipped<br>and fell. Fritz barked with laughter as he galloped<br>out of sight. Alan slowly picked himself up. He<br>knew he had to find Fritz before Mr. Gasazi discov-<br>ered him. Bruised and tired, he hurried off in the<br>dog\'s direction.<br>After a long search Alan was ready to give up. He<br>was afraid he might never find Fritz. But then he<br>came upon fresh dog prints. Slowly he followed<br>Fritz\'s tracks along a path that led into a forest. The<br>dirt path ended and a brick walk began. There were<br>no more tracks to follow, but Alan was certain that<br>Fritz must be just ahead.<br>Alan started running. In front of him he could see a<br>clearing in the forest. As he came dashing out of the<br>woods he stopped as quickly as if he had run up<br>against a wall. For there, in front of him, stood a<br>truly awesome sight. It was the house of Gasazi.<br>Alan nervously climbed the great stairs, convinced<br>Fritz had come this way and been captured.<br>The boy\'s heart was pounding when he arrived at<br>the huge door. He took a deep breath and reached<br>for the bell, but before he touched it the door swung<br>open. There, in the shadow of the hallway, stood<br>Gasazi the Great. \'Greetings, do come in\' was all<br>that he said.<br>Alan followed Gasazi into a large room. When the<br>magician turned around Alan quickly apologized for<br>letting Fritz into the garden. He politely asked that<br>if Mr. Gasazi had Fritz, would he please give him<br>back? The magician listened carefully and then,<br>smiling, said, \'Certainly you may have your little<br>Fritzie. Follow me.\' With those words he went to<br>the door and led Alan back outside.<br>They were walking across the lawn when suddenly<br>Gasazi stopped by a gathering of ducks. He began to<br>speak in a voice that was more like a growl. \'I<br>detest dogs. They dig up my flowers, they chew on<br>my trees. Do you know what I do to dogs I find in<br>my garden?\' \'What?\' whispered Alan, almost<br>afraid to hear the answer. \'I TURN THEM INTO<br>DUCKS!\' bellowed Gasazi. In horror, Alan looked<br>at the birds in front of him. When one duck came<br>forward, Gasazi said, \'There\'s your Fritz.\' Alan<br>begged the magician to change Fritz back. \'Impos-<br>sible,\' he answered, \'only time can do that. This<br>spell may last years or perhaps just a day. Now take<br>your dear bird and please don\'t come again.\'<br>When Alan took the bird in his arms it tried to give<br>him a bite. \'Good old boy,\' said Alan sadly as he<br>patted the bird on the head. \'You really haven\'t<br>changed so much.\' With tears in his eyes he started<br>for home. Behind him Alan could hear Gasazi<br>laughing. As he approached the stairway, a gust of<br>wind took Alan\'s hat sailing right off his head. Run-<br>ning along with one arm reaching for the hat, Alan<br>lost his hold on Fritz. The duck flew out ahead and<br>grabbed the hat in midair. But instead of landing he<br>just kept on flying, higher and higher, until he disap-<br>peared in the afternoon clouds.<br>Alan just stood and stared at the empty sky. \'Good-<br>bye, old fellow,\' he called out sadly, sure that Fritz<br>was gone forever. At least he had something to chew<br>on. Slowly, one step after another, Alan found his<br>way back to the garden gate and over the bridge. It<br>was sunset by the time he reached Miss Hester\'s.<br>Lights were on and he knew she must be home.<br>With a heavy heart he approached the door, wonder-<br>ing how Miss Hester would take the news.<br>When Miss Hester came to the door Alan blurted<br>out his incredible story. He could barely hold back<br>the tears; then, racing out of the kitchen, dog food on<br>his nose, came Fritz. Alan couldn\'t believe his eyes.<br>\'I\'m afraid Mr. Gasazi played a trick on you,\' said<br>Miss Hester, trying to hide a smile. \'Fritz was in the<br>front yard when I returned. He must have found his<br>own way home while you were with Mr. Gasazi. You<br>see, Alan, no one can really turn dogs into ducks;<br>that old magician just made you think that duck was<br>Fritz.<br>Alan felt very silly. He promised himself he\'d never<br>be fooled like that again. He was too old to believe<br>in magic. Miss hester watched from the porch as<br>Alan waved goodbye and hurried down the road to<br>go home. Then she called out to Fritz, who was<br>playfully running around the front yard. He came<br>trotting up the front steps with something in his<br>mouth and dropped it at Miss Hester\'s feet. \'Why<br>you bad dog,\' she said. \'What are you doing with<br>Alan\'s hat?\'","char_name":"ALAN"},{"book_id":"L252","text":"In a cave in the woods,<br>in his deep, dark lair,<br>through the long, cold winter<br>sleeps a great brown bear.<br>Cuddled in a heap,<br>with his eyes shut tight,<br>he sleeps through the day,<br>he sleeps through the night.<br>The cold winds howl<br>and the night sounds growl.<br>But<br>the bear<br>snores on.<br>An itty-bitty mouse,<br>pitter-pat, tip-toe,<br>creep-crawls in the cave<br>from the fluff-cold snow.<br>Mouse squeaks, \'Too damp,<br>too dank, too dark.\'<br>So he lights wee twigs<br>with a small, hot spark.<br>The coals pip-pop and the wind doesn\'t stop.<br>But<br>the bear<br>snores on.<br>Two glowing eyes<br>sneak-peek in the den.<br>Mouse cries, \'Who\'s there?\'<br>and a hare hops in.<br>\'Ho, Mouse!\' says Hare.<br>\'Long time, no see!\'<br>So they pop white corn.<br>And they brew black tea.<br>Mouse sips wee slurps.<br>Hare burps big BURPS!<br>But<br>the bear<br>snores on.<br>A badger scuttles by,<br>sniff-snuffs at the air.<br>\'I smell yummy-yums!<br>Perhaps we can share?<br>\'I\'ve brought honey-nuts,\'<br>Badger says with a grin.<br>\'Let\'s divvy them up,<br>cozy down ... and dig in!\'<br>And they nibble and they munch with a<br>CHEW-<br>CHOMP-<br>CRUNCH!<br>But<br>the bear<br>snores on.<br>A gopher and a mole<br>tunnel up through the floor.<br>Then a wren and a raven<br>flutter in through the door!<br>Mole mutters, \'What a night!\'<br>\'When a storm!\' twitters Wren.<br>And everybody clutters<br>in the great bear\'s den.<br>They tweet and they titter.

who built her so well said, This Little House shall never be sold for gold or silver and she will live to see our great-great-grandchildren\'s great-great-grandchildren living in her.<br>The Little House was very happy as she sat on the hill and watched the countryside around her.<br>She watched the sun rise in the morning and she watched the sun set in the evening.<br>Day followed day, each one a little different form the one before . . . but the Little House stayed just the same.<br>In the nights she watched the moon grow from a thin new moon to a full moon, then back again to a thin old moon; and when there was no moon she watched the stars.<br>Way off in the distance she could see the lights of the city.<br>The Little House was curious about the city and wondered what it would be like to live there.<br>Time passed quickly for the Little House as she watched the countryside slowly change with the seasons.<br>In the Spring, when the days grew longer and the sun warmer, she waited for the first robin to return from the South.<br>She watched the grass turn green.<br>She watched the buds on the trees swell and the apple trees burst into blossom.<br>She watched the children playing in the brook.<br>In the long Summer days she sat in the sun and watched the trees cover themselves with leaves and the white daisies cover the hill.<br>She watched the gardens grow, and she watched the apples turn red and ripen.<br>She watched the children swimming in the pool.<br>In the Fall, when the days grew shorter and the nights colder, she watched the first frost turn the leaves to bright yellow and orange and red.<br>She watched the harvest gathered and the apples picked.<br>She watched the children going back to school.<br>In the Winter, when the nights were long and the days short, and the countryside covered with snow, she watched the children coasting and skating.<br>Year followed year.<br>The apple trees grew old and new ones were planted.<br>The children grew up and went away to the city . . . and now at night the lights of the city seemed brighter and closer.<br>One day the Little House was surprised to see a horseless carriage coming down the winding country road.<br>Pretty soon there were more of them on the road and fewer carriages pulled by horses.<br>Pretty soon along came some surveyors and surveyed a line in front of the Little House.<br>Pretty soon along came a steam shovel and dug a road through the hill covered with daisies.<br>Then some trucks came and dumped big stones on the road, then some trucks with little stones, then some trucks with tar and sand, and finally a steam roller came and rolled it all smooth, and the road was done.<br>Now the Little House watched the trucks and automobiles going back and forth to the city.<br>Gasoline stations . . . roadside stands . . . and small houses followed the new road.<br>Everyone and everything moved much faster now than before.<br>More roads were made, and the countryside was divided into lots.<br>More houses and bigger houses . . . apartment houses and tenement houses . . . schools . . . stores . . . and garages spread over the land and crowded around the Little House.<br>No one wanted to live in her and take care of her any more.<br>She couldn\'t be sold for gold or silver, so she just stayed there and watched.<br>Now it was not so quiet and peaceful at night.<br>Now the lights of the city were bright and very close, and the street lights shone all night.<br>This must be living in the city, thought the Little House, and didn\'t know whether she liked it or not.<br>She missed the field of daisies and the apple trees dancing in the moonlight.<br>Pretty soon there were trolley cars going back and forth in front of the Little House.<br>They went back and forth all day and part of the night.<br>Everyone seemed to be very busy and everyone seemed to be in a hurry.<br>Pretty soon there was an elevated train going back and forth above the Little House.<br>The air was filled with dust and smoke, and the noise was so loud that it shook the Little House.<br>Now she couldn\'t tell when Spring came, or Summer or Fall, or Winter.<br>It al seemed about the same.<br>Pretty soon there was a subway going back and forth underneath the Little House.<br>She couldn\'t see it, but she could feel and hear it.<br>People were moving faster and faster.<br>No one noticed the Little House any more.<br>They hurried by without a glance.<br>Pretty soon they tore down the apartment houses and tenement houses around the Little House and started digging big cellars . . . one on each side.<br>The steam shovels dug down three stories on one side and four stories on the other side.<br>Pretty soon they started building up . . .<br>They built up twenty-five stories on one side and thirty-five stories on the other.<br>Now the Little House only saw the sun at noon, and didn\'t see the moon or starts at night at all because the lights of the city were too bright.<br>She didn\'t like living in the city.<br>At night she used to dream of the country and the field of daisies and the apple trees dancing in the moonlight.<br>The Little House was very sad and lonely.<br>Her paint was cracked and dirty . . .<br>Her windows were broken and her shutters hung crookedly.<br>She looked shabby . . . though she was just as good a house as ever underneath.<br>Then one fine morning in Spring along came the great-great-granddaughter of the man who built the Little House so well.<br>She saw the shabby Little House, but she didn\'t hurry by.<br>There was something about the Little House that made her stop and look again.<br>She said to her husband, That Little House looks just like the Little House my grandmother lived in when she was a little girl, only that Little House was way out in the country on a hill covered with daisies and apple trees growing around.<br>The found out it was the very same house, so the went to the Movers to see if the Little House could be moved.<br>The Movers looked the Little House all over and said, Sure, this house is as good as ever.<br>She\'s build so well we could move her anywhere.<br>So they jacked up the Little House and put her on wheels.<br>Traffic was held up for hours as they slowly moved her out of the city.<br>At first the Little House was frightened, but after she got used to it she rather liked it.<br>They rolled along the big road, and they rolled along the little roads, until they were way out in the country.<br>When the Little House saw the green grass and heard the birds singing, she didn\'t feel sad any more.<br>They went along and along, but they couldn\'t seem to find just the right place.<br>They tried the Little House here, and they tried her there.<br>Finally they saw a little hill in the middle of the field . . . and apple trees growing around.<br>There, said the great-great-granddaughter, that\'s just the place.<br>Yes, it is, said the Little House to herself.<br>A cellar was dug on top of the hill and slowly they moved the house from the road to the hill.<br>The windows and shutters were fixed and once again they painted her a lovely shade of pink.<br>As the Little House settled down on her new foundation, she smiled happily.<br>Once again she could watch the sun and moon and stars.<br>Once again she could watch Spring and Summer and Fall and Winter come and go.<br>Once again she was lived in and taken care of.<br>Never again would she be curious about the city . . .<br>Never again would she want to live there . . .<br>The stars twinkled above her . . .<br>A new moon was coming up . . .<br>It was Spring . . . and all was peaceful in the country.","char_name":"THE LITTLE HOUSE"},{"book_id":"M36","text":"Once upon a time there

old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don\'t go into Mr. McGregor\'s garden: your father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.<br>Now run along, and don\'t get into mischief.<br>I am going out.<br>Then old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker\'s.<br>She bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.<br>Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries.<br>But Peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to Mr. McGregor\'s garden, and squeezed under the gate!<br>First he ate some lettuces and some French beans; and then he ate some radishes; and then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.<br>But round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should be meet but Mr. McGregor!<br>Mr. McGregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after Peter, waving a rake and calling out, Stop thief!<br>Peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.<br>He lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.<br>After losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that I think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket.<br>It was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.<br>Peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.<br>Mr. McGregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter; but Peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him, and rushed into the toolshed, and jumped into a can.<br>It would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.<br>Mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed, perhaps hidden underneath a flowerpot.<br>He began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.<br>Presently Peter sneezed – Kertyschoo!<br>Mr. McGregor was after him in no time, and tried to put his foot upon Peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants.<br>The window was too small for Mr. McGregor, and he was tired of running after Peter.<br>He went back to his work.<br>Peter sat down to rest.<br>He was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had no the least idea which way to go.<br>Also, he was very damp with sitting in that can.<br>After a time began to wander about, going lippity – lippity – not very fast, and looking all around.<br>He found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.<br>An old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood.<br>Peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer.<br>She only shook her head at him.<br>Peter began to cry.<br>Then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled.<br>Presently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor filled his water cans.<br>A white cat was staring at some goldfish; she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive.<br>Peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little Benjamin Bunny.<br>He went back towards the toolshed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe – scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.<br>Peter scuttered underneath the bushes.<br>But presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow, and peeped over.<br>The first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing his onions.<br>His back was turned towards Peter, and beyond him was the gate.<br>Peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow, and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.<br>Mr. McGregor caught sight of him at the corner, but Peter did not care.<br>He slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.<br>Mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scarecrow to frighten blackbirds.<br>Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir tree.<br>He was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit hole, and shut his eyes.<br>His mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes.<br>It was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!<br>I\'m sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening.<br>His mother put him to bed, and made some chamomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to Peter!<br>One tablespoonful to be taken at

with her Pa, her Ma, her big sister Mary, her baby sister Carrie, and their good old bulldog Jack.<br>Winter was coming to the Big Woods.<br>Soon the little house would be covered with snow.<br>Pa went hunting every day so that they would have meat during the long, cold winter.<br>Ma, Laura, and Mary gathered potatoes and carrots, beets and turnips, cabbages and onions, and peppers and pumpkins from the garden next to the little house.<br>By the time winter came, the little house was full of good things to eat.<br>Laura and Mary thought the attic was a lovely place to play.<br>They played house by using the round orange pumpkins as tables and chairs, and everything was snug and cozy.<br>Soon the first snow came, and it was very cold.<br>In the mornings the windows were covered with beautiful frost pictures of trees and flowers and fairies.<br>Ma said that Jack Frost came in the night and made the pictures while everyone was asleep.<br>Laura and Mary were allowed to use Ma\'s thimble to make pretty patterns of circles in the frost.<br>In the mornings Laura and Mary helped Ma wash the dishes and make the beds.<br>After this was done, Ma began the work that belonged to that day.<br>Each day had its own proper work.<br>Ma would say<br>Wash on Monday, Iron on Tuesday, mend on Wednesday, churn on Thursday, clean on Friday, bake on Saturday, rest on Sunday.<br>Laura liked the churning and baking days best of all.<br>Ma had to churn the cream for a long time until it turned into butter.<br>Mary could sometimes churn while Ma rested, but Laura was too little.<br>On Saturdays, when Ma made the bread, Laura and Mary each had a little piece of dough to make into a little loaf.<br>Ma even gave them a bit of cookie dough to make little cookies.<br>After the day\'s work was done, Ma would sometimes cut out paper dolls for Laura and Mary.<br>She drew their faces on with a pencil, and cut dresses, hats, and ribbons out of colored paper so that Mary and Laura could dress their dolls beautifully.<br>But the best time of all was at night, when Pa came home.<br>He would throw off his fur cap and coat and mittens and call, Where\'s my little half-pint of sweet cider half drunk up?<br>That was Laura, because she was so small.<br>Sometimes Pa would take down his fiddle and sing.<br>Pa would keep time with his foot.<br>Laura and Mary would clap their hands to the

flowers.<br>The Lupine Lady is little and old.<br>But she has not always been that way.<br>I know.<br>She is my great-aunt, and she told me so.<br>Once upon a time she was a little girl named Alice, who lived in a city by the sea.<br>From the front stoop she could see the wharves and the bristling masts of tall ships.<br>Many years ago her grandfather had come to America on a large sailing ship.<br>Now he worked in the shop at the bottom of the house, making figureheads for the prows of ships, and carving Indians out of wood to put in front of cigar stores.<br>For Alice\'s grandfather was an artist.<br>He pained pictures, too, of sailing ships and places across the sea.<br>When he was very busy, Alice helped him put in the skies.<br>In the evening Alice sat on her grandfather\'s knee and listened to his stories of faraway places.<br>When he had finished, Alice would say, When I grow up, I too will go to faraway places, and when I grow old, I too will live beside the sea.<br>That is all very well, little Alice, said her grandfather, but there is a third thing you must do.<br>What is that? asked Alice.<br>You must do something to make the world more beautiful, said her grandfather.<br>All right, said Alice.<br>But she did not know what that could be.<br>In the meantime Alice got up and washed her face and ate porridge for breakfast.<br>She went to school and came home and did her homework.<br>And pretty soon she was grown up.<br>Then my Great-aunt Alice set out to do the three things she had told her grandfather she was going to do.<br>She left home and went to live in another city far from the sea and the salt air.<br>There she worked in a library, dusting books and keeping them from getting mixed up, and helping people find the ones they wanted.<br>Some of the books told her about faraway places.<br>People called her Miss Rumphius now.<br>Sometimes she went to the conservatory in the middle of the park.<br>When she stepped inside on a wintry day, the warm moist air wrapped itself around her, and the sweet smell of jasmine filled her nose.<br>This is almost like a tropical isle, said Miss Rumphius.<br>But not quite.<br>So Miss Rumphius went to a real tropical island, where people kept cockatoos and monkeys as pets.<br>She walked on long beaches, picking up beautiful shells.<br>One day she met the Bapa Raja, king of a fishing village.<br>You must be tired, he said.<br>Come into my house and rest.<br>So Miss Rumphius went in and met the Bapa Raja\'s wife.<br>The Bapa Raja himself fetched a green coconut and cut a slice off the top so that Miss Rumphius could drink the coconut water inside.<br>Before she left, the Bapa Raja gave her a beautiful mother-of-pearl shell on which he had painted a bird of paradise and the words, You will always remain in my heart.<br>You will always remain in mine too, said Miss Rumphius.<br>My great-aunt Miss Alice Rumphius climbed tall mountains where the snow never melted.<br>She went through jungles and across deserts.<br>She saw lions playing and kangaroos jumping.<br>And everywhere she made friends she would never forget.<br>Finally she came to the Land of the Lotus-Eaters, and there, getting off a camel, she hurt her back.<br>What a foolish thing to do, said Miss Rumphius.<br>Well, I have certainly seen faraway places.<br>Maybe it is time to find my place by the sea.<br>And it was, and she did.<br>From the Porch of her new house Miss Rumphius watched the sun come up; she watched it cross the heavens and sparkle on the water; and she saw it set in glory in the evening.<br>She started a little garden among the rocks that surrounded her house, and she planted a few flower seeds in the stony ground.<br>Miss Rumphius was almost perfectly happy.<br>But there is still one more thing I have to do, she said.<br>I have to do something to make the world more beautiful.<br>But what?<br>The world already is pretty nice, she thought, looking out over the ocean.<br>The next spring Miss Rumphius was not very well.<br>Her back was bothering her again, and she had to stay in bed most of the time.<br>The flowers she had planted the summer before had come up and bloomed in spite of the stony ground.<br>She could see them from her bedroom window, blue and purple and rose-colored.<br>Lupines, said Miss Rumphius with satisfaction.<br>I have always loved lupines the best.<br>I wish I could plant more seeds this summer so that I could have still more flowers next year.<br>But she was not able to.<br>After a hard winter spring came.<br>Miss Rumphius was feeling much better.<br>Now she could take walks again.<br>One afternoon she started to go up and over the hill, where she had not been in a long time.<br>I don\'t believe my eyes! she cried when she got to the top.<br>For there on the other side of the hill was a large patch of blue and purple and rose-colored lupines!<br>It was the wind, she said as she knelt in delight.<br>It was the wind that brought the seeds from my garden here!<br>And the birds must have helped!<br>Then Miss Rumphius had a wonderful ideal<br>She hurried home and got out her seed catalogues.<br>She sent off to the very best seed house for five bushels of lupine seed.<br>All that summer Miss Rumphius, her pockets full of seeds, wandered over fields and headlands, sowing lupines.<br>She scattered seeds along the highways and down the country lanes.<br>She flung handfuls of them around the schoolhouse and back of the church.<br>She tossed them into hollows and along stone walls.<br>Her back didn\'t hurt her any more at all.<br>Now some people called her That Crazy Old Lady.<br>The next spring there were lupines everywhere.<br>Fields and hillsides were covered with blue and purple and rose-colored flowers.<br>They bloomed along the highways and down the lanes.<br>Bright patches lay around the schoolhouse and back of the church.<br>Down in the hollows and along the stone walls grew the beautiful flowers.<br>Miss Rumphius had done the third, the most difficult thing of all!<br>My Great-aunt Alice, Miss Rumphius, is very old now.<br>Her hair is very white.<br>Every year there are more and more lupines.<br>Now they call her the Lupine Lady.<br>Sometimes my friends stand with me outside her gate, curious to see the old, old lady who planted the fields of lupines.<br>When she invites us in, they come slowly.<br>They think she is the oldest woman in the world.<br>Often she tells us stories of faraway places.<br>When I grow up, I tell her, I too will go to faraway places and come home to live by the sea.<br>That is all very well, little Alice, says my aunt, but there is a third thing you must do.<br>What is that? I ask.<br>You must do something to make the world more beautiful.<br>All right, I say.<br>But I do not know yet what that can be.","char_name":"LUPINE LADY"}]'
