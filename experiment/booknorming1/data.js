he left a trail of burnt forests and horses\' bones.<br>Finally, Elizabeth came to a cave with a large door that had a huge knocker on it.<br>She took hold of the knocker and banged on the door.<br>The dragon stuck his nose out of the door and said, Well, a princess!<br>I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today.<br>I am a very busy dragon.<br>Come back tomorrow.<br>He slammed the door so fast that Elizabeth almost got her nose caught.<br>Elizabeth grabbed the knocker and banged on the door again.<br>The dragon stuck his nose out of the door and said, Go away.<br>I love to eat princesses, but I have already eaten a whole castle today.<br>I am a very busy dragon.<br>Come back tomorrow.<br>Wait, shouted Elizabeth.<br>Is it true that you are the smartest and fiercest dragon in the whole world?<br>Yes, said the dragon.<br>Fantastic, said Elizabeth, and the dragon took another huge breath and breathed out so much fire that he burnt up one hundred forests.<br>Magnificent, said Elizabeth, and the dragon took another huge breath, but this time nothing came out.<br>The dragon didn\'t even have enough fire left to cook a meatball.<br>Elizabeth said, Dragon, is it true that you can fly around the world in just ten seconds?<br>Why, yes, said the dragon, and jumped up and flew all the way around the world in just ten seconds.<br>He was very tired when he got back, but Elizabeth shouted, Fantastic, do it again!<br>So the dragon jumped up and flew around the whole world in just twenty seconds.<br>When he got back he was too tired to talk, and he lay down and went straight to sleep.<br>Elizabeth whispered, very softly, Hey, dragon.<br>The dragon didn\'t move at all.<br>She lifted up the dragon\'s ear and put her head right inside.<br>She shouted as loud as she could, Hey, dragon!<br>The dragon was so tired he didn\'t even move.<br>Elizabeth walked right over the dragon and opened the door to the cave.<br>There was Prince Ronald.<br>He looked at her and said, Elizabeth, you are a mess!<br>You smell like ashes, your hair is all tangled and you are wearing a dirty old paper bag.<br>Come back when you are dressed like a real princess.<br>Ronald, said Elizabeth, your clothes are really pretty and your hair is very neat.<br>You look like a real prince, but you are a bum.<br>They didn\'t get married after all."},{"book_id":"M89","title":"WINTER DAYS IN THE BIG WOODS","char_name":["LAURA","MARY","MA","PA"],"text":"Once upon a time, a little girl named Laura lived in the Big Woods of Wisconsin in a little house made of logs.<br>Laura lived in the little house with her Pa, her Ma, her big sister Mary, her baby sister Carrie, and their good old bulldog Jack.<br>Winter was coming to the Big Woods.<br>Soon the little house would be covered with snow.<br>Pa went hunting every day so that they would have meat during the long, cold winter.<br>Ma, Laura, and Mary gathered potatoes and carrots, beets and turnips, cabbages and onions, and peppers and pumpkins from the garden next to the little house.<br>By the time winter came, the little house was full of good things to eat.<br>Laura and Mary thought the attic was a lovely place to play.<br>They played house by using the round orange pumpkins as tables and chairs, and everything was snug and cozy.<br>Soon the first snow came, and it was very cold.<br>In the mornings the windows were covered with beautiful frost pictures of trees and flowers and fairies.<br>Ma said that Jack Frost came in the night and made the pictures while everyone was asleep.<br>Laura and Mary were allowed to use Ma\'s thimble to make pretty patterns of circles in the frost.<br>In the mornings Laura and Mary helped Ma wash the dishes and make the beds.<br>After this was done, Ma began the work that belonged to that day.<br>Each day had its own proper work.<br>Ma would say<br>Wash on Monday, Iron on Tuesday, mend on Wednesday, churn on Thursday, clean on Friday, bake on Saturday, rest on Sunday.<br>Laura liked the churning and baking days best of all.<br>Ma had to churn the cream for a long time until it turned into butter.<br>Mary could sometimes churn while Ma rested, but Laura was too little.<br>On Saturdays, when Ma made the bread, Laura and Mary each had a little piece of dough to make into a little loaf.<br>Ma even gave them a bit of cookie dough to make little cookies.<br>After the day\'s work was done, Ma would sometimes cut out paper dolls for Laura and Mary.<br>She drew their faces on with a pencil, and cut dresses, hats, and ribbons out of colored paper so that Mary and Laura could dress their dolls beautifully.<br>But the best time of all was at night, when Pa came home.<br>He would throw off his fur cap and coat and mittens and call, Where\'s my little half-pint of sweet cider half drunk up?<br>That was Laura, because she was so small.<br>Sometimes Pa would take down his fiddle and sing.<br>Pa would keep time with his foot.<br>Laura and Mary would clap their hands to the music when he sang:<br>Yankee Doodle went to town, He wore his striped trousies, he swore he couldn\'t see the town, there was so many houses.<br>Other times Pa would tell stories.<br>When Laura and Mary begged him for a story, he would take them on his knees and tickle their faces with his long whiskers until they laughed out loud.<br>His eyes were blue and merry.<br>Outside it was cold and snowy, but the little log cabin was snug and cozy.<br>Pa, Ma, Laura, Mary, and Baby Carrie were comfortable and happy in their little house in the Big Woods."}]'
