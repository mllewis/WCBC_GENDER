You will complete a quick survey in which you will be shown some images, words, or hear some sounds and asked to make judgments about them. For example, you may be asked how typical a picture of a dog is of dogs in general, or to identify an ambiguous drawing, decide what word a sound makes you think of, to choose which visual pattern best completes a sequence of patterns, or indicate how vividly you see in your mind's eye. HIT instructions will be provided on the next screen.    </p><p> This task has no anticipated risks nor direct benefits. If you have any questions or concerns about this HIT please contact the principal investigator: Dr. Gary Lupyan at lupyan@wisc.edu. If you are not satisfied with response of the research team, have more questions, or want to talk with someone about your rights as a research participant, you should contact University of Wisconsin's Education Research and Social and Behavioral Science IRB Office at 608-263-2320.

The Pacific Ocean astonished him.<br>For three weeks he did not see land. When land finally appeared<br>it was the New World.<br>He explored North America by train and riverboat, and often walked<br>for days on end.<br>Deserts with rocks like enormous sculptures amazed him.<br>The endless farm field reminded him of the ocean he had crossed.<br>Huge cities of factories and tall buildings bewildered and yet excited him<br>He marveled at the towering mountains and rivers as clear as the sky.<br>He met many people along the way. He shook hands with black men<br>and white men, with yellow men and red men.<br>The more he traveled, the more he longed to see new places, and never<br>thought of returning home.<br>Of all the places he visited, he liked California best. He loved the<br>strong sunlight there, the Sierra Mountains, the lonely seacoast.<br>After a time, he returned to his village in Japan to marry his childhood<br>sweetheart. Then he brought his bride to the new country.<br>They made their home by the San Francisco Bay and had a baby girl.<br>As his daughter grew, my grandfather began to think about his own childhood.<br>He thought about his old friends.<br>He remembered the mountains and rivers of his home. He surrounded<br>himself with songbirds, but he could not forget.<br>Finally, when his daughter was nearly grown, he could wait no more.<br>He took his family and returned to his homeland.<br>Once again he saw the mountains and rivers of his childhood.<br>They were just as he had remembered them.<br>Once again he exchanged stories and laughed with his old friends.<br>But the village was not a place for a daughter from San Francisco.<br>So my grandfather bought a house in a large city nearby.<br>There, the young woman fell in love, married, and sometime later I was born.<br>When I was a small boy, my favorite weekend was a visit to my<br>grandfather's house. He told me many stories about California.<br>He raised warblers and silvereyes, but he could not forget the mountains<br>And rivers of California. So he planned a trip.<br>But a war began. Bombs fell from the sky and scattered our lives<br>like leaves in a storm.<br>When the war ended, there was nothing left of the city and of the house<br>where my grandparents had lived.<br>So they returned to the village where they had been children.<br>But my grandfather never kept another songbird.<br>The last time I saw him, my grandfather said that he longed to see California<br>One more time. He never did.<br>And when I was nearly grown, I left home and went to see California<br>for myself.<br>After a time, I came to love the land my grandfather had loved,<br>and I stayed on and on until I had a daughter of my own.<br>But I also miss the mountains and rivers of my childhood.<br>I miss my old friends. So I return now and then, when I can not still<br>the longing in my heart.<br>The funny thing is, the moment I am in one country,<br>I am homesick for the other.<br>I think I know my grandfather now.<br>I miss him very much.</p>","0","html-button-response","2","136553","0.0-2.0-0.0","69132","NA","","","Mon Sep 21 2020 20:02:19 GMT-0500 (Central Daylight Time)","","","","","","","","","",""
