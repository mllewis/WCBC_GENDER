You will complete a quick survey in which you will be shown some images, words, or hear some sounds and asked to make judgments about them. For example, you may be asked how typical a picture of a dog is of dogs in general, or to identify an ambiguous drawing, decide what word a sound makes you think of, to choose which visual pattern best completes a sequence of patterns, or indicate how vividly you see in your mind's eye. HIT instructions will be provided on the next screen.    </p><p> This task has no anticipated risks nor direct benefits. If you have any questions or concerns about this HIT please contact the principal investigator: Dr. Gary Lupyan at lupyan@wisc.edu. If you are not satisfied with response of the research team, have more questions, or want to talk with someone about your rights as a research participant, you should contact University of Wisconsin's Education Research and Social and Behavioral Science IRB Office at 608-263-2320.
